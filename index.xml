Topics to hit Friends (expats in Iraq are the most interesting and most boring, generally down on the NGO industry, homo sacer the country)
academics are the best, met brilliant people who spend a lot of time, but also people who spend too much time, and its at the risk of harming yourself Karbala, it&amp;rsquo;s great, it&amp;rsquo;s also intensely frustrating, the food is really bad

      <description>Abstract The United Nations Assistance Mission in Iraq (UNAMI) has generated numerous reports on their engagements with the Iraqi political system since 2003. At the same time, Iraq has developed into a unwritten sectarian form of government, where particular cabinet posts are reserved for different groups. This paper evaluates, what, if any, role UNAMI has played in preventing the formation of sectarian identities, in reading UNAMI&amp;rsquo;s reports from 2003 to 2010.</description>

Working Title: UNAMI&amp;rsquo;s Stumble into Sectarian Narratives Main Research Questions and Arguments Research Question: Have the mandates for UNAMI substantively shifted to counteract sectarian identities in Iraq, or have they supported these identities in a form of &amp;ldquo;liddism&amp;rdquo;? Argument: The perspective of international human rights promulgated by the UN is inherently a western-liberal one that favors states, because of UNAMI&amp;rsquo;s position, it has inherently favored Iraq&amp;rsquo;s drift towards an unwritten sectarian government (muhasasa ta’ifia) in its pursuit of mandates.</description>

1-1 meetings are useful for collecting and receiving feedback early.
Avoid: One sided convo All business MIA Distractions Do: Goal settings Consistency is key! Give and receieve feedback Get to known your intern and prioritize personal well-being Encourage brainstorming and problem solving Okay to skip once, never skip twice Ask about their goals What&amp;rsquo;ve they been working on in the side? Use open ended questions Dig deeper, ask them a lot of questions Guide, without just giving the answers and have people brainstorm with you Setup a time for the intern to meet with other team members </description>

Israel&amp;rsquo;s war objectives were not defined consistently, wanted to both destroy hezbollah, return israeli soldiers, halt the firiing of rockets, etc
Ultimately seen as a failure, the critical issue was that israel assumed everyone subscribed to the same understanding of objectives, whereas hezbollah&amp;rsquo;s objective was to simply survive
General Dan Halutz stepped down after this war, advocated that &amp;lsquo;vicotry is a matter of consciousness&amp;rsquo;

CUP officiers arrived in early years of Afghanistan under Aman Allah, where they played a major role in early &amp;ldquo;moderization&amp;rdquo;.
Presents a very rosy Pan-Islamic view of the CUP officiers.
Aman Allah Greatly respected mustafa kemal Configured the early Afghan state Multiple leaps in early jurisprudence in afghanistan, such as: oversight of a constitutional draft committee comprised of jurists and theorists and members of the ummah All laws drafted under the first constitutional committee required a match with sharia law before passing to Aman Allah Later years hampered by aggressive spending, eventually ousted in 1928 </description>

Airlines spent 96% of free cash flow on stock buybacks
Airline bailout is not strict
For instance, some of the money is in cheap loans, and some in grants that will be forgiven if the carriers fly right No minders
But in a less capital-serving bailout, another problem is who the minders would be. Remember AIG? The government appointed three trustees. There’s no evidence they did anything other than collect fees and confer a veneer of legitimacy.</description>

What questions are being asked?
How do we concieve of jursiprudence? How are sharia law and fiqh used to mediate between the state and the masses? Is the current viewing of shariah as a condified set of rules a direct desendant of colonial times? Are modern state law and shariah law incompatible? Was the encoding of sharia into strict Western jurisprudence a product of colonial practices, or of modernity?</description>

Notes How relevant is this at this point? After latest (per September 1, 2022) conflicts between hashd al-shaabi (PMF) and Muqtada al-Sadr, does this offer any understanding? Preface Conventional western models of DDR and SSR appear irrelevant or unenformcable in countries where competition in fractured societies and the absences of strong institutions preclude their implmentation - p 9 calls on dialogue 1 - The Past, Present &amp;amp; Future of Militias - Raaj Alaaldin Interventions in kosovo and iraq paved the way for weakneing of the international system Undermined principals of soveriengty and created an environment where other world powers can pursue their own interests under the guise of same legal and normative arguments russia in georgia, ukraine, and syria Violence between states has disappeared West has engaged in optimistic, at times unrealistic policy making questions of the fragility of the state and rehabilitation frames the question, whereas militias are the result of long-standing pre-war legacies of dysfunctional governace and authoritarianism It is not the conflict or the immediate aftermath, but longstanding greviances and a sense of injustice argues that civil society is better positioned to challenge the promience of militias and can constitute a means through which to discourage the youth from joining armed groups demographics of the region, especially through youth bulges and growing population rates hezbollah paradoxically bridged the gap by providing services where the state couldn&amp;rsquo;t, but also hinder the state&amp;rsquo;s remergence transnational shia militia groups have transitioned in iraq have transition into socio-political organizations asks us how can we separate these?</description>

Beyond the basic understanding of Algerian law from the French as a single source that displaces and breaks family and tribal lands, this is the molding of the Algerian body into prostitution. Paceman tells us about the sexual differences and how the public is the domain of the masculine while the private is the domain of the feminine, and a key portion is that men are allowed to cross by way of property.</description>

I recently read an article by Patrick Wyman on how empires in decline have their wars reverberate back on them. The gist of it: empires typically have their domestic affairs shielded away from their foreign actions. It&amp;rsquo;s only when empires are in decline that you see the actions in foreign lands affect things back home. In the case of the US, the failed wars of Iraq and Afghanistan contribute to the militarization of the police and erosion of the rights of domestic citizens, such as the case of Portland and federal paramilitary snatching up protestors.</description>

Review/Response Talal Asad is deeply concerned about the concept of friendship in this book, and steps through an linguistic analogy of untranslatability, followed by a numerical one about the state using numbers, and ending with a statement about amr bil maruf. In the classical Asad&amp;rsquo;ian way, the point comes across through a variety of writers and sources, drawing from Jakobson to Gilgamesh to Arendt and a gaggle of other characters.</description>

What is the difference between the trivial and the profound? Notion of the context and the meaning carves out into three separations The data is not the event itself, but rather the recording of it no data can ever truly be &amp;ldquo;raw&amp;rdquo; the imperfectly defined heuristic concepts &amp;ldquo;ego&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;anxiety&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;instinct&amp;rdquo;, etc the fundalmentals laws of thermodynamics, law of large numbers, etc Explanation, therefore, is the mapping of data onto fundalmentals, but the ultimate goal of science is to increase fundalmental knowledge states that the social sciences continue to stay within the field of heuristic concepts, inductively testing it against the data in hopes of moving it into the fundalmentals asks us to abandon total induction obeservations cannot be denied, fundalmentals must be fitted prediction is a poor tool for testing a hyposthesis - https://backreaction.</description>

Introduction Most people expect revolutions to &amp;ldquo;simply&amp;rdquo; happen Revolution without &amp;ldquo;revolutionary ideas&amp;rdquo; No shariati, Rousseau, etc Revolutions of Wrong Times Marxist-Lenist liberation front in PDRY and Oman Why did the meaning of &amp;ldquo;revolution&amp;rdquo; become &amp;ldquo;refolution&amp;rdquo;? 1970 Revolutions Reza Shah Ali Shariati Moderate Clerics and Islamic figures like Mehdi Bazagarn became leaders and evening lecturers Oil refinery workers and nationwide strike brought down the regime Arab World Nasserite anti-Imperialism Maxism-Lenism Victory for NLF in yemen opened the door for a People&amp;rsquo;s Front for the Liberation of Oman in mid 1960&amp;rsquo;s palestine liberation organization (PLO) Arab Spring Mohamed Bouazizi tunisia Trade unionists played pivotal role egypt Largely related to Tunisia the &amp;ldquo;We are all Khaled Said&amp;rdquo; movement (April 6 Youth Movement) Toppled Mubarak yemen brought down Ali Abudllah Saleh bahrain - thousands of Sunni and Shia occupied Pearl Roundable in Manama, three month Emergency law in response Big differences between Arab Spring and 1970 Revolutions &amp;ldquo;Lacked any associated intellectual anchor&amp;rdquo; - pg 11 &amp;ldquo;Unlike the revolutions of the 1970&amp;rsquo;s that espoused a powerful socialist, anti-imperialist, anticapitalist, and social justice implulse, Arab revolutionaries were preoccupied more with the borad issues oif human rights, political accountability, and legal reform&amp;rdquo; - pg 11 How much of this is due to peripherialization?</description>

Force does not solve all problems, and force and peacekeeping are two different things We must understand that this means peacekeeping is only one part of it force only works in conjunction with the political ends, much like counterterrorism Simpson - War from the Ground Up &amp;ldquo;For all its finely balanced and properly justified criticism of UN actions in Bosnia, that conclusion was also at the heart of the Srebrenica Report issued in 1999: &amp;ldquo;peacekeeping and war fighting are distinct activities and should not be mixed&amp;rdquo; (UN 1999a, 107).</description>

Talks about how collective punishment is meted out by the Saddam regime. Primary thesis concerns the legibility of citizenry, the more &amp;ldquo;legible&amp;rdquo; the citizenry is to the regime, the more targeted punishments become.
Homogenous socities with dictators spawn low trust because the society is relatively easy to be infiltrated.
Collective punishment heightens group identities, such as the case of:
Stalin &amp;amp; Ukranians Bedouins in the Sinai Japanese internment in WWII Introduction Difficult to study dictators and internal politics of a country while the dictator is in power 3 key constraints on Saddam&amp;rsquo;s power Saddam did not make the entire country politically legible to central gov Highly vulnerable state to external shocks Miscalculated international response to key foreign policy decisions Paradox of control: European states focus on the development of strong territorial states African states focus on the struggle to project political power across territory Iraq struggles to project power despite rich state Major modern historians of Iraq Jabar Davis Visser Haddad Khoury Yousif Helfony Blaydes proposes the idea of &amp;ldquo;cultural distance&amp;rdquo; References Brubakar, 2004 &amp;ldquo;Ethnicity without groups&amp;rdquo; Chapter 2 Anfal campaign came during the Iran-Iraq War Information was difficult to collect in the north Citizens often cooperate with democratic regimes becaues they trust it Why do citizens cooperate with authoritarian ones?</description>

Refugees and history are a two way street, internal refugees of the Ottoman empire are seen as chess pieces when in fact they shape policy. The book attemps to bring Balkan refugees, Albania, Anatolia, and Mandata Iraq and Syria in the same style as Anscombe - State, Faith, and Nation, enlarging the frame of the &amp;ldquo;post-Ottoman&amp;rdquo;. Also pulls in the domination of international finance and capitalism as a centripedal force.</description>

The consequences will likely prove destabiliz-ing, both locally and beyond. Opposition to an entrenched political elite may take a more violent turn if citizens realize that yet again, voting in elections will not result in real change. That would further expose the clear divergence of strategic in-terests that has arisen among NATO partners dur-ing the Trump era.</description>

Introduces the concepts of edge triggering and level triggering, derived from the idea of an interrupt, talks about how systems should respond to the shape of an electrical signal over time.
Should the system care about when the signal changes from low &amp;lt;- high or high -&amp;gt; low, or if the signal is high? Thresholds vs state changes
Abstractly, there&amp;rsquo;s no differences between edge and level triggering, the only difference is the sample rate, if a system doesn&amp;rsquo;t sample fast enough, we may miss a trigger, especially when there&amp;rsquo;s an outage.</description>

Large report on how the UN un department of peacekeeping (DPKO) operations need to be changed in light of recent conflicts
&amp;ldquo;In 2000, the Brahimi Report proposed important doctrinal changes. The document suggested a cautious move from the narrow, Cold War inspired objectives of national security to the broader, post Cold War inspired ambitions of collective human security (Peou 2002: 51). Rather than perceiving people as citizens of particular states, the philosophy underlying human security regards all human beings as part of a global, state-transcending, community.</description>

Summary The researchers showed that using biases are inherent to the statistical frequency of specific words - distributional hypothesis in linguistics They developed a method similar to the Implict Association Test called Word Embedding Association Test, which measures the cosine similarity of specific words. Largely a study that shows that all the stereotypes and biases show from the IAT are apart of word embeddings, meaning that bias is not necessarily escapable here by tuning the dataset Note that this only captured word embeddings and only captured Glove.</description>

https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~adrian/731-sp04/readings/GL-cap.pdf Main takeaways:
Most systems in early distributed relational design did not take into account partition tolerance (aka mostly CA) network partition puts pressure on strong consistency and high availability strong consistency and performance have tension during normal operation how consistent does your data actually need to be - if availability is necessary, then we need to explore whether consistency models other than strong consistency are workable consistency and availability are not binary choices unless you limit yourself to strong consistency - https://www.</description>

Linguistic Contributions - Past, Present, and Future 3 lectures by Chomsky Past 19th and 20the centuries have had linguistics, philosophy, and psychology go their separate ways, the problem of the mind has served to link the disparate fields back together Karl Lashley, 1948 - argued that underlying language use - and all organized behavior - must contain abstract mechanisms of some sort that are not analyzable in terms of association and could not be developed by simple means Points that mental structures are not &amp;ldquo;more of the same&amp;rdquo;, but rather they are quality very different than the complex networks and structures that can be developed by scaling up not just degree of complexity, but the quality of complexity Physics to Cartesian and Newton was not adequately grounded, since it still postulated the mystical force of gravity, just as Descartes’ postulation of the mind Spanish physicians Juan Harte - Late 16th century, published about intelligence, which gives 3 levels: sensory, self-sustaining, and generative this is the groundwork for the physchological theory that the use of language is a correct index of intelligence Descartes observed that even low level languages is totally unattainable by apes However, this asks us, is reasoning generative of speech?</description>

Week 4 Writeup In doing this week&amp;rsquo;s readings, I thought to myself how we should curse Fukuyama not for writing &amp;ldquo;The End of History?&amp;rdquo;, but causing the deluge of writings that came after, talking about how hypocracy is built into the liberal system. Like an endless parade, papers like Hansen and Stepputat go around presenting the modern state&amp;rsquo;s actions as some sort of gotcha, as if the prior work hadn&amp;rsquo;t made that already clear.</description>

Inis L. Claude Jr. “Collective Security as an Approach to Peace.” Accessed February 2, 2021.
Collective security is a halfway point between anarchy and world governement talks about how collective security has become a bandied about term, but means something completely different The achievement of orthodox status is very often fatal to the integreity of a concept
&amp;ldquo;collective security&amp;rdquo; began as a specialized term, initially meant to hamstring aggressions now has largely lost its meaning, appropriated for any &amp;amp; all approaches to collective actions that build peace and order, synonym for world peace collective security should be defined as &amp;ldquo;a second line of defense against wars where settlement should but does not prevent a war&amp;rdquo; assumptions: wars are likely to occur and most can be prevented about forestalling the arbitrary &amp;amp; aggresive use of force constract with pacific security pacific security - moral ambiguity, uses tools like investigating, reconciliation, arbitration, etc collective security - moral clarity, uses diplomatic, economic, and military sanctions subjective requirements on collective security aggression in one part of the world is not localized, things can easily spread people &amp;amp; states must recongize their interests align with the international demands that many national loyalities become harmonized is this similar to how domestic institutions ahve aligned with Barnett et al: International Organizations and the Diffusions of Power?</description>

https://www.instapaper.com/read/1295231133 Gentle, yet insistent executive summary: If you don&amp;rsquo;t know how compilers work, then you don&amp;rsquo;t know how computers work. If you&amp;rsquo;re not 100% sure whether you know how compilers work, then you don&amp;rsquo;t know how they work.</description>

US The Senate’s consent to ratify the CTBT requires the acknowledgement of a central reality: The United States is not going to resume nuclear testing after a 28-year moratorium. The Stockpile Stewardship program is a major success story. Its continued bipartisan support is assured. The nuclear labs have answered the questions that Senators like John Warner (R-VA) and Dick Lugar (R-IN) had at its inception, leading them to conclude that it was premature to vote for ratification in 1999.</description>

Computational syntax is concerned about the questions of the structures of natural language sentences (grammar):
what kinds of representations allow you best to describe what sentences are grammatical/possible in a langauge? what kidns of sentence structure are and are not possible in any given human languages? to what extent are these grammatical rules langauge-specific and learnbed, and to what extend to they represent something universal about human cognition?</description>

Convolutions is applying a filter to an input that results in an activation, such as with convolutional neural networks (cnn)
For ml, a convolution is a linear operation that involves the multiplation of a set of weights with the input
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-zd-T17uiE for convolutional neural networks (cnn)
the filter is smaller than the input data and is mulitplied by the dot product smaller is intentional, allows the filter to be reused across multiple places in the image if we design the filter to detect a specific type of feature, then this can be discovered anywhere in the image (aka translation invariance, checking if the feature is present rather than where it was present) pytorch implements this with conv2d</description>

The completion of the Aswan Low Dam was premised on orientialist perceptions that the British would &amp;lsquo;modernize&amp;rsquo; the Egyptians.
Ended up miscalculating Did not respect the environmental impacts of this British engineers saw this as a time to experiment as well as a time to dig into their &amp;ldquo;Christian&amp;rdquo; past for relics Did not respect the cyclic abundance of the Nile Farmers now needed to use more fertilizer Mitchell notes that by 1933 due to the Aswan Low Dam project only, “one-fifth of the Nile valley was now irrigated by the river’s annual flood, which in the past had fertilized the soil by depositing a layer of silt and nutrients…By the end of the 1930s Egyptian farmers were using 600,000 tons of fertilizer a year - pg 7, from Mitchel - Rule of Experts: Egypt, Techno-politics, Modernity Attempts at the regulating the Nile had been done before Persistent belief from the British that the Egyptians were somehow &amp;ldquo;squandering&amp;rdquo; the Nile Dam did not account for salination like in irrigation in iraq with the dujayla land project </description>

Introduction Entailment When A entails B -&amp;gt; when A happens, B happens
To reason correct, it is not enough if the presmises and conclusion is true, it needs to also be true if things happen differently.
Arguments whose premises entail the conclusion are \(\texttt{valid}\), others \(\texttt{invalid}\).
An argument is valid iff: under all circumstances in which the presmises would be true, the conclusion is also true.</description>

Damascus, syria https://www.instapaper.com/read/1299358661 Despite the justification given for this, on grounds of enforcing “social distancing,” I can’t help being reminded of the notion of the urban-rural binary, and the degrading treatment of people from rural areas whenever they pass through the cities. Fear of the pandemic prompted Bashar al-Assad to issue a general amnesty for crimes committed before 22 March of this year, but this amnesty did not cover political detainees held in security branches, whom the regime does not recognize at all.</description>

Makes the case that stabilization has largely come at the cost of peacekeeping Stabilization has focused on propping up state authority, but this may not necessarily be the best move diversion of funds accusations that stabilization is &amp;ldquo;liddism&amp;rdquo;, or just keeping the lid stable enough but is not moving towards durable peacekeeping first forms of stabilization were in yugoslavia, but kosovo, iraq, afghanistan were all apart of this united nations multidimensional integrated stabilization mission in mali (MINUSMA) is one of the biggest offenders, alongside united nations multidimensional integrated stabilization mission in the central african republic (MINUSCA), and united nations stabilization mission in the democratic republic of the congo (MONUSCO) stabilization is largely never brought up in UN documents, but is heavily invested in by operations in the case of united nations stabilization mission in the democratic republic of the congo (MONUSCO), almost entirely about propping up the government, even human rights violations happen with the national army UN may be stepping back from cases of deep inclusivity </description>

Turkish politics hold contradictory viewpoints of Ottomanism, esepcially with the AKP. Before 2010 even Western pundits cited Erdogan&amp;rsquo;s rapprochement with Syria as neo-Ottomanism, but then after said it was neo-Ottomanism to support the Sunni anti-Assad opposition.

Break down: https://eng.lyft.com/envoy-7-months-later-41986c2fd443 First Section On September 14, 2016 we announced Envoy, our L7 proxy and communication bus. In a nutshell, Envoy is a “service mesh” substrate that provides common utilities such as service discovery, load balancing, rate limiting, circuit breaking, stats, logging, tracing, etc. to polyglot (heterogeneous) application architectures.
We knew that we had built a compelling product that was central to Lyft’s ability to scale its service-oriented architecture; however, we were surprised by the industry wide interest in Envoy following its launch.</description>

Uses the &amp;lsquo;Bourdieusian method&amp;rsquo; of political field where people vie to understand the influence of de-Ba&amp;rsquo;atificiation and the creation of the Muhasasa Ta&amp;rsquo;ifa appointment system.
Typical sectarian thesis is that ruling elites use sectarianism in order to bolster their own legitimacy. This assumes both a pilable public and awesome power of information spread.
habitus is used as a foundation for the understanding of political parties in Iraq, the mixed big-tent parties with intensely sectarian ones is because “it sees that agency as constrained by the boundaries of the possible set by the political field they are competing in as well as their own habitus” - pg 119</description>

In &amp;ldquo;Violence and History: A Response to Thandika Mkandawire&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo;, Stephen Ellis puts forth the notion that analysis of violence must be grounded in a historical context in order for proper analysis. Starting as a response to THandika Mkandawire, who originally criticized Ellis&amp;rsquo;s work, Ellis deconstructs Mkandawire&amp;rsquo;s theory of an urban/rural divide as the principal driver of violence within Africa. Going beyond this, Ellis pushes violence into a historical background, stating that the context of violence, mediated through symbols and modern habits, requires history to properly understand.</description>

      <description>Prompt: Where does responsibility for violence suffered by migrants lie?
Draft Migrants suffer a litany of horrors on their path to their ultimate destination. Existing on the bounded continuum, migrants are labeled somewhere between &amp;ldquo;refugee&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;economic migrant&amp;rdquo;. This dual classification, with significant grey area in between, affords people different rights and treatment along the way. For example, the term refugee carries implies significant loss of agency, but garners international sympathy and affords access to certain institutions.</description>

Memes, alongside their production and consumption change banal reality into a fictionalized existence. Trump is a uniquely &amp;ldquo;memable&amp;rdquo; president, not only by literally a Game of Thrones meme when declaring the American withdraw from the JCPOA1, but also that he has had many moments that cross into the absurd. Take the infamous &amp;ldquo;glowing orb&amp;rdquo; photo, where Trump joined King Salman of Saudi Arabia and President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt, in the opening of a new anti-extremist center2.</description>

Word embedding is an nlp technique to map text or words to vectors
Allows vector space operations to happen, such as summing or computing the distances of vectors
word2vec fasttext gpt2 Once words are generated into individual vectors, combine them into text vectors (aka document or sentence vecotrs)
Easy way typically sums or averages the vectors together Two snippets of text are discovered by mapping both of them into vector space and finding the distances between the vectors</description>

https://www.linkedin.com/learning/developing-your-emotional-intelligence/benefits-of-building-emotional-intelligence?autoplay=true&amp;amp;u=2131553 What is emotional intelligence? 3 keys factors Definition How does it fit in with mental structure? Why is it important? Definition Understanding and expressing emotions Using empathy Sometimes defined as EQ (emotional quotient) Being aware of emotions Expressing emotions Controlling emotions Relationship management 4 areas: Self awareness Self management Social awareness Relationship development Role of emotions and EQ Understand and manage the role of emotions Emotions Feelings about event Behavior Response to event Thinking at the speed of light Takes conscious practice to be aware of how emotional response works Intercept response process 2 ways of thinking fast, emotional, intuitive thinking leads us to use biases slow, deliberate, emotional Understanding Personal EQ Behavior is often associated with a specific event We think of our behavior as a reaction We think event -&amp;gt; behavior Actually event -&amp;gt; thoughts and feelings -&amp;gt; behavior Triggers and Hijacks Trigger, emotions, and irrational response Cognitive shortcuts help our brains focus on important information Triggers Events or thoughts that consistently take you in the wrong direction Finding Flow Flow: complete immersion in an activiity should feel effortless and rewarding understand what causes a sense of flow Developing emotional intelligence helps find flow Disrupting Thinking Simple process to take control of feelings ABCDE model A - Activating event Example: coworker is late with deliverable To understand the event, understand it as a bystander B - Beliefs C - Consequence D - disruptive thinking Look at the situation from another perspective E - Effect Reclaim Reaction Time Factors that lead to subjectivity Thoughts Feelings Emotions Slowing down reactions Identify the emotional reaction Remove yourself from the situation when you start feeling strong emotions Focus on emotion Live in the emotion, give it some time Challenge on thoughts Choose how to respond Reasonably assess the best option and react accordingly Shifting Perspective Consider different points of view, not necesarilly changing opinion Key here is to seek out alternative points of view Ask more questions Ask others how they see the world around them Spend time with new people Read more books on a variety of topics Using Senses to Make Sense The ability to understand others and respond to their needs Building social awareness Looking inward Shift focus outward Think about what our senses are telling us in situations Do we notice details about events going on around us?</description>

      <description>Tags: statistics
Both properties of stochastic process, ensemble average is effectively the expected value, whereas the time average is a strict random variable.
Time average of a stochastic process is simply the average value of a single outcome of a stochastic process.
Modern economics tends to conflate these and use ensemble averages when a time average is probably better.

https://www.nature.com/articles/srep17531 https://github.com/seansaito/Explaining-Away-Attacks-Against-Neural-Networks Explaining away is a pattern of reasoning that the confirmation of one cause of an obsereved event reduces the need to invoke other causes. Example:
A causes C
B causes C
C happened, A is observed
Implies B did not happen However, B and A can happen at the same time. Sources

Fortna, Virginia Page. “Does Peacekeeping Keep Peace? International Intervention and the Duration of Peace after Civil War.” International Studies Quarterly 48, no. 2 (2004): 269–92.
Often repeated tropes that peacekeeping should only be done when &amp;ldquo;there is a peace to keep&amp;rdquo; from Brahimi report ignores that UN is often more likely to succeed in lower conflict situations situations where there is a clear victory is less likely to see UN peacekeepers, but more likely to see regional peacekeepers finds that, since the cold war, peacekeeping does work peace enforcement has been found to result in unstable peace where nations later reenter war, possibly liddism (Curran and Hunt: Stabilization at the Expense of Peacekeeping in UN Operations) finds that peace will generally be easier to maintain after wars with a decisive victor, after long wars, and in countries of higher development </description>

The Karbala ritual of radat (الردات الكربلائي سياسي, lit the karbala political responses) during Muharram is underdiscussed. Despite how many people try to use religion as a scrying sheet for political predictions in Iraq, very little discussion has been had on radat, a ritual that literally has &amp;ldquo;political&amp;rdquo; in the name! I recently tweeted about my favorite radat of late, and thought that I should elaborate on what it symbolizes.</description>

Gambling is what makes us human. In this era of intense bureaucratization, what happens is that gambles are the last holes of freedom afforded to us.
This is why technology is interesting, because it holds the same revolutionary potential as well as enforcement of bureaucracy China is example, technology acts as both a centralizing work of technology, but also nevertheless provides a form of potentiality because the government is incessantly afraid of it Bureaucracy, Mitchel: Economentality, statistics as the language and priestwork of the modern world Enchantments of Mammon development theory Violence inflicted is much greater in bureaucracies, police violence, insurance, DMV, etc States of exception as found to end &amp;ldquo;Are you going to live your life one adventure to the next?</description>

One day Tokusan told his student Ganto, I have two monks who have been here for many years. Go and examine them. Ganto picked up an axe and went to the hut where the two monks were meditating. He raised the axe, saying, If you say a word I will cut off your heads; and if you do not say a word, I will also cut off your heads.</description>

Makes the difference between critque and criticism Attempts to offer up a way to analyze religion by not looking at where they are common, but question the unity of the text However, still sees the text as fundalmentally anthropological in approach three layers of thematic, argumenative, and grammatical What if we moved beyond religion as text to religion as performance? are anthropoloigsts too eager to draw casual conclusions w/o statistics?</description>

https://www.mgasch.com/post/k8sevents/
Talks about how the Kube API server is the fundalmental broker with multiple replicated logs or queues. Events are causually related, and every controllers (k8s) can be understood to be a producer and/or consumer of events from these logs.
ListWatch in k8s, which lists all events from the API server when the consumer starts, then switches to &amp;ldquo;watch mode&amp;rdquo; to reduce the load queue is fundalmentally decoupling both the consumer and producer (with a queue) No guarentee that things will ever reach the desired state, but it is optimistically trying, which makes controllers stateless even when they handle state operations, and do not require persistency!</description>

More complexity of isomorphism -&amp;gt; the more software is required ot extract meaning
Language uses isomorphisms to generate meaning, the symbols are imbued with meaning
Example: two objects collide in a vaccum, noise is not created, noise a function of the medium, not the collision
Music -&amp;gt; level one meaning of the grooves on a viynl
level two depends on a chain of isomorphisms</description>

Axiom schema are the framework for axioms Any formal system that lets you make longer theorems from shorter ones requires a decision procedure, which leads to halting problem any constructions of an isomorphism induces meaning, because if there is a way to transform the information without losing it, then there is inherent meaning in the information interpretation vs meaning intepretation - what the symbol represents meaning - the underlying thing systems can take on multipl;e passive meanings do formal systems always need to map onto reality?</description>

Talks about the divide between Lowith and Blumenberg debate
Lowith Modern philosophy holds itself independent Lowith argues that the mundane and non-religious form requires religion as the defining character, which means that secularity cannot exist without religion Lowith&amp;rsquo;s book runs backwards through time, starts with modern represenitives and walks back from Marx, Hegel, Comte to thinkers of the enlightenment, all the way back to the midieval theologicans. Attempts to show that Chrisitianity laid the framework for secularization Examines Burckhardt&amp;rsquo;s attempts to unshackle philosphy, ends up not totally successful, stating that Marx&amp;rsquo;s historical providence of capitalists were its last judgement Lowith extends the messanic faith of Marx into Hegel&amp;rsquo;s philosphy of history, noting that Hegel cannot resolve the profound ambiguity Interestingly, Lowith uses the Augustinianian distinction between temporality and eternity to serve as the fundalmental measurement Distinguishes between the concept of the consonant and dissonant geneaology Consonant geneaology tells us more about a concept Dissonent geneaology exposes contradictions in the background assumptions Lowith uses a dissonant geneaology to expose dissonance in the self-conception of modernity Blumenberg Fought against the idea that modern progress was somehow illegitimate Noted that the logic of modernity contained own, internal ideas of progress that could be kept intact Notes the Kantian idea of &amp;ldquo;self-authorization&amp;rdquo; </description>

Identifies that most mandates, when it comes to choosing between some objectives and the protection of civilians objective, due to the ambiguity of the protection of civilians, has not been able to accomplish as much in POC Post-2015 High-Level Independent Panel on UN Peace Operations (HIPPO) suggested the &amp;ldquo;sequenced mandates&amp;rdquo; idea mitigates the &amp;ldquo;cookie-cutter&amp;rdquo; mandates that are bloated also allows the inclusion of activities that may be necessary, and the exclusion of activities that may be the wrong time argues that mission specific objetives set out by the security council may be harmful, might be best to do a phased mandate where the mandate reevaluates its objectives within 2/6 months risks of phased mandates adjustment too frequently leaves missions unable to plan successfully political attention to a crisis may decline over time, so mandate revisions may be problematic conditions on the ground change rapidly, conditions may change from a recently-adjusted madate.</description>

      <description>Tags: books, sectarianism
Overview &amp;lsquo;sectarianism&amp;rsquo; as a term is too broad and doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean anything he suggests a 4 pillar approach, building on top of Hinnebusch - Identity and State Formation in Multi‐sectarian Societies doctrinal substate state suprastate Brubaker: Religious Dimensions of Political Conflict and Violence Religion is a necessary but not sufficient event for the formation of sectarian identities Skip past the fetishization doctrine and the pervasive binary of Sunni/Shia Also poor debates that unity is a manichean good that opposes sectarianism coexistence, intermarriage, and kinship are not a bar to the outbreak of hostilities context, flebility, and salience enough for raw symbolisism for everything to be framed everything is correlated - the context, flexibility, and salience make religious markers easy to adapt we cannot view things as a dichmoety of above/below, for elites are also the product of their own systems, so the cynical view of elites manipulating their system is false Formations of Sectarian identities Identity is a difference between contest vs contestation Weiss - In the Shadows of Sectarianism amman message (2005) and mecca declaration (2006) were doctrinal and had clerical buy in, but did bridge sectarian divisions religion is often times not the main driver but can fan the flames, schisms can create legitimacy for divisions &amp;ldquo;To ask if sectarian dynamics are driven by religion or politics is to ask the wrong question.</description>

Talks about the nationalist power of Ottoman narratives, especially in light of places like Albania, Macedonia, etc.
Concludes with that the idea of &amp;lsquo;Ottoman ruins&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;countries emerging from the ruins&amp;rsquo; is fundalmentally flawed, there is more for the past to teach us
Making Ottoman synonmyous with Islamic or Turkish influences is a defining hallmark of the 19th century Balkan nationalist projects that perceived the Ottoman Empire as a &amp;lsquo;religiously, socially, and institutionally alien imposition on autochthonous Christian medieval socities.</description>

War is profitable only if victory is quickly gained. Only an aggressor can hope to gain a quick victory. If he is frustrated, the war is bound to be long, and mutually ruinous, unless it is brought to an end by mutual agreement.

Rise of linkages of &amp;ldquo;domestic&amp;rdquo; organizations across sister states rise of private tribunals nonstate actors have gained their own powers, distinct from lobbying groups global governeance is not monolithic, but rather fractured un sustainable development goals security why are states willing to diffuse authority?</description>

      <description>history of islamic law
Essay Intro Shia rituals during Muharram are performed in the public, often accompainying cries of passion and various acts, such as beatings of the chest (latm), reciting elegies of martyrs during the events of Karbala (majilis al-aza), back flagellation (zangeel), head laceration (tatbir), reenactment of Hussein&amp;rsquo;s death (taziyeh), and. An oft heard refrain within elegies and lamations is &amp;ldquo;Every day is Ashura, every land is Karbala&amp;rdquo;, bridging the current time with the events of Karbala.</description>

Georgio Agamben&amp;rsquo;s idea of Homo Sacer, a revival of the classical Roman idea of &amp;ldquo;sacer&amp;rdquo; mixes the concepts of &amp;ldquo;sacred&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;cursed&amp;rdquo;. The concept revolves around state power and biopolitics, but roughly it maps to how certain life cannot be readily sacrified, but can be destroyed without punishment.
However, Agamben always envisioned this as a state of exception within power relations between the central state. An overarching position of power, with the means to enforce violence became the central feature of Agamben&amp;rsquo;s work, ending with his frequent cries about potential camps in Europe.</description>

What is homogenous time? If you take Sara Pursely&amp;rsquo;s book Familiar Futures, homogenous time lies at the core of modern society today pg. 10. She describes how by the standardization of homogenous time, capitalism, which is predicated upon &amp;ldquo;uniform duration and endless repetition&amp;rdquo;, has evolved. While her frame of analysis is the history of Iraq, I think it&amp;rsquo;s a bit more interesting if we push past a pure historical or even anthropological frame.</description>

FLP states that, under ths async model, there is no deterministic algorithm for consensus
there is no way to solve the consensus problem under a very minimal system model in a way that cannot be delayed forever
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_%28computer_science%29#Solvability_results_for_some_agreement_problems
Consensus is impossible with one faulty process w/o allowing for failure dectors like local timers (https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~lorenzo/corsi/cs380d/papers/p225-chandra.pdf) or randomization (https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/800221.806707)

      <description>Introduction Massive infrastructure projects within the 20th century have typically been harnessed for nationalistic purposes. While most analysis focuses on the nationalism generating certain types of public works projects, projects constructed under colonial governments and then semi-independent governments reflect much upon the status of a state as well. Irrigation projects in particular are interesting as they are the nexus for a multitude of interests. Dams and irrigation projects may be built to tame natural events such as flooding, used to generate electricity to support a growing population, used as irrigation channels to allow for more productive agriculture.</description>

&amp;ldquo;The ijtihadic hermeneutics Hallaq has written about were predicated partly on a set of assumptions running throughout Islamic jurisprudence, to wit, that &amp;ldquo;each individual and circumstance was deemed unique, requiring ijtihad [independent reasoning; innovative legal interpretation of (or on the basis of) sacred texts; judicial creativity] that was context-specific&amp;rdquo; (2009, 546), and that this reasoning should therefore typically take into consideration (among other things) a relatively expansive range of disputants&amp;rsquo; actions, intentions, character traits, and biographical data.</description>

Generic paper on mechanisms that people use to learn how to troubleshoot and debug Notes that working memory, analytical reasoning, and casual reasoning are all important aspects of effective troubleshooting Also goes through the various ways that people have been taught how to troubleshoot in the past, such as procedural demonstration, conceptual instruction, rule-based approaches, simulations, and intelligent tutoring systems Coginitive Model of Troubleshooting Construct problem space (novice troubleshooters will rely on external problem representations) talks Identify Fault Systems Diagnose Faults (experienced troubleshooters will categorize problems based on prior experiences) four types of hypotheses generated: system: fault at the system level subsystem: fault at the subsystem level, reduces the problem space to a discrete subsystem device: reduces it to a specific device component: reduces to a single fault at the component it seems this categorization is mostly just general, isn&amp;rsquo;t what&amp;rsquo;s important the ability to drill down into specific sections Generate and Verify Solutions Remeber Experience Although this is also more likely to happen as a result of post-mortems Architecture for Troubleshooting Learning Proposes a system to help learn troubleshooting as well based on a case of previous examples </description>

From Simpson - War from the Ground Up posits that mainstream narratives of most civil wars tend to locate violence in terms of macro-level emotions, ideaologies, or cultures. empirical evidence points to a far more complex or fragmented analysis incorrectly labeled as &amp;lsquo;madness&amp;rsquo; Cramer - Civil War is Not a Stupid Thing Civil war works the other way around, it privatizes politics, transforms local and personal grievances into lethal violence, and endows violence with political meaning that may naturalize into new and enduring identities logic of civil war is to be found on a micro level Domination of national level cleavages, grassroots dynamics are often percieved merely as their local manifestations argues that the agency in the violence of civil wars is partially a function of &amp;lsquo;alliance&amp;rsquo; between the center and the periphery that both use the other to their advantage &amp;lsquo;master-narratives&amp;rsquo; can legitmately identify main cleavages, but is usually accorded too much significane &amp;lsquo;actions in civil war&amp;rsquo; are not necssarily politica, and do not always reflect deep ideological polarization civil war fosters a process of interaction between actors with distinct idenitites and interests it is the convergence between local motives and supralocal that endows civil war with its intimate character and leads to joint violence that straddles the divide betwen the political and the private, the collective and the individual </description>

Karim and Beardsley, “Explaining Sexual Exploitation and Abuse in Peacekeeping Missions.”
Uses the composition of peacekeeping troops along two dimensions - proportions of women and the records of gender (inequality) in the contributing countries to track for sexual exploitation and abuse (SEA)
mission level information from 2009 to 2013 indicates that higher levels of female peacekeepers and personnel from countries with better records of gender equality is associated with lower levels of SEA allegations</description>

Uses &amp;ldquo;happens before&amp;rdquo; - partial ordering of events
Introduces a way to sync the total ordering provides for clocks, how to translate it to actual clocks is time subjective? is it independent of observers?
is there a way to capture &amp;ldquo;happen before&amp;rdquo; without clocks?
can we determine if a single event preceded another without the measurement of objective time? on differing nodes total ordering of events cannot be done, only partial ordering on specific nodes 1: a-b-c 2: x-y-z a comes before b and c, but a does not come before x, y, or z &amp;ldquo;happens before&amp;rdquo;</description>

Class 1 What do linguists do? Linguists as part of cognitive science What is the consquences of this view? Chomsky - Syntatic Structures as the dawn of generative grammar There exists some sentences of setnences such that it allows for recursive composition So once we setup the idea that English cannot be a FSM, what is the data? Langauges that use case markings case markings allow it to mtaintain a more consistent structure modulo case marking chomsky is unconcerned with the statistical metadata that arises from a corpus &amp;ldquo;internalist&amp;rdquo; - grammars and structures within a single sentence &amp;ldquo;externalist&amp;rdquo; - set of sentences within a corpus for sentences to make sense, we assign a phoronlogical structure to pronounce sentences which then means a sentence makes sense iff: syntax (chomsky is here) is correct phoronological sufficent (this can be derived from statistics) &amp;ldquo;there exists a faculty of language&amp;rdquo; - but is there a single faculty of langauge Class 2 - 9/13 what is the neo-durkheimian relationship between langauge and thought?</description>

one of the hardest things is to know when to quit a process that&amp;rsquo;s not working model, document, share/mandate how do you scale consistency within a team? often times architecture and product groups begin to arise presenting: start with the conclusion! from topic and narration prepare a lot, practice a little value, narrate, ask, diagnosis, principles, what&amp;rsquo;s next, ask &amp;lt;- general plan of attack work the policy ask, but know from the policy where you can ask velocity context for alerts how likely is something to be escaled to an outage scenario?</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m writing this just as I&amp;rsquo;ve passed my A1 level exam for Spanish. Currently, the hope is to be conversationally fluent in Spanish by Thanksgiving 2023, but we&amp;rsquo;ll see how that works out as time goes on. Given that this is my fourth language, I figured I&amp;rsquo;d write a little about what works and what doesn&amp;rsquo;t work.
Language learning, in my opinion, is actually an extremely boring ask, filled with mostly just one thing: reptition.</description>

Summary Deep learning uses multiple layers to learn representations of data with multiple levels of abstraction
Supervised Learning most common
show inputs and annotations
create an objective function that measures errors
most people use stochastic gradient descent
known since 1960 that linear classifers only carve their input space into very simple regions (half spaces separated by a hyperplane)</description>

https://lwn.net/Articles/276782/ Intro What does a linker do? Converts object files into executables and shared libraries C/C++/Fortran (java uses a loader) What&amp;rsquo;s a linker: Dynamic linking, linker data types, linker operation Shared libs shared libs were invented as an op for virtual memory systems running many processes simultaneously virtual memory system would map the same routine for each process first implementation in SVR3, based on COFF assigned each shared library a fixed portion of virtual address space SunOS4 introduced a more fleixbile version programs would link shared librarys during runtime (dynamic linker) program linker are the linkers during compilation Basic Linker Data Types Linkers use symbols, relocations, and contents Symbols Name and a value usually represent static objects in the original source code For C, a single symbol for each function and each global and static variable used to indicate a reference to a name defined in another file Relocation Computation to perform on the contents Usually refers to a symbol and a offset Also provides an additional operand called addend Simple relocation is &amp;ldquo;set this location in the contents to the value of this symbol + addend&amp;rdquo; Contents What memory should look like during the execution of the program Have a size, array of bytes, and a type Contain machine code generated by the compiler and assembler (text) Also contain values of initialized variables (data) Also contain static unnamed data like string constants or switch varialbes (rdata) Empty uninitalized variables as well Basic Linker Operation Linkers:</description>

Middle east studies has had many people contend over it Beginnings rooted in the study in &amp;ldquo;Ancient Greece&amp;rdquo; Linking between Athens and US/Britian is to distort history by projecting our own conceptions onto the past The idea that &amp;ldquo;Asian&amp;rdquo; countries were ruled by tyrants and people were servile is very old, barbarians at the gate Roman legacies were pronouced, especially as the empire split Word of god often used to justify the large-scale enslavement and European conquest European writers tended to see muslims in ethnic rather than religious views Crusades were largely bludgeoning as well &amp;ldquo;Knowing the enemy&amp;rdquo; became big in the middle ages, for revival purposes Ibn Sina, Ibn Rushd, Maimonides all read arabic Perceptions of the Ottomans as in perpetual decline Ottoman law, society, and statecraft were seen as despotic The west saw the east as a place to define what the west was Spread of empire brought about cultural orietnialism, such as eroticized and titillating drawings of Muslims Akin to modern fetishism of Muslim women/KRG women Marx bought into this as well, the economic basis for despotism was characteristic of Asian societies &amp;ldquo;Indian society has no history at all&amp;rdquo; Also saw colonialism as a necessary and progressive factor in human history American large influences on middle east studies via foundations following WWII, in light of the cold war First strains were largely orientalist, it took islam as a coherent civilization that was static and unchanging Concepts of an &amp;ldquo;Arab mind&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Muslim mind&amp;rdquo; Followed by strong strains of modernization theory (1950&amp;rsquo;s 1970&amp;rsquo;s) Failure of modernization theory with lebanese civil war Disillusionment with government work Shortage of people with language skills in government Modernization theory saw local elites playing a crucial role in introducing change into societies (like the Shah) Orientialism drew a sharp line between Islam and the West, modernization theory drew sharp divide between tradition and modernity, two different stages in one human evolution Turmoil started w/ Abdel-Malek&amp;rsquo;s Egypt: Military Society Modernization theory&amp;rsquo;s failures in Latin America made it suspect Seminal article &amp;ldquo;Sociology of Development and Underdevelopment of Society&amp;rdquo; Showed that there were greater benefits to breaking out of capitalist investment system Vietnam War&amp;rsquo;s breakdown of US consensus Rereadings of history followed Islamism&amp;rsquo;s rise posed a problem for modernization theory Orientialism Argued with a focult conception what we take to be truth is in fact always really the product of a certain way of depicting or representing reality, of a certain “discourse” – a structured system of meaning which shapes what we perceive, think and do.</description>

      <description>Tags: papers, computers, hci
Summary Talks about how people are influenced on their views of intelligent systems based on their first impressions and their familiartiy with the topic.
Notably, domain experts fail to regain trust in the system, even if the system gets better over time. Consistently achieve automation bias and believe in the system, even if it is wrong.
Domain expertise plays an important role.
Implications &amp;ldquo;Rather than allowing users to use a system with zero understanding or a poor mental model of how the system works, designers can incorporate introductory sessions to alert users about system strengths and shortcomings so that users can decide whether and when they should trust the system&amp;rsquo;s outputs.</description>

Talks about how slavery cannot be defined solely as chattel slavery Argues against the notion put out by Orlando Patterson and Bruce Hall Islamic forms of slavery were actually a part of the slave market that eventually turned into chattel slavery Chattel slavery and free people were two sides of the same coin, examples where the people were the most free (like Athens) also had the most chattel slavery Shift of greeks and romans from half free people to reliance on chattel slaves from outside was the emergence of the idea of freedom Argues that Patterson, in his attempt to find a coherent definition of slavery, overlooked many differences In Islam, Mamaluks In Ethopia, various other groups Early data about #s of slaves were largely anecdotal and basically wild guesses Zanj rebellion in Iraq, lead by Ali Large, spartacus like revolt from Southern iraq of free people and poors Lasted over 15 years Race based slavery was a western import, largely allowing for racialized taxonomies with colonialization previously one could &amp;ldquo;become&amp;rdquo; an arab, just as you could convert to islam Haterin in northern Morocco Universal definitions of slavery is a fool&amp;rsquo;s errand, too difficult to actually conceptualize Segregation produces a clear divide between slave and non-slave, while the dominant discourse on slavery has been defined as the meeting point of abolitionist and Orientialist </description>

Syntax is at the core of generative grammar sentences of a language as a sequence of units that re-occur can be sounds, roughly represented by words (letters as a semiotic of sounds) what separates a word salad (sentence with no meaning) and a sentence with meaning? are human languages finite state languages, aka those generated from finite state grammars? - chomsky separators of phrases (commas and words) cannot be replaced without losing meaning, but we can insert additional phrases in between without losing original meaning however, does chomsky operate on only made up sentences?</description>

Contests Asad - Formations of the Secular on his denial of the concept of religion Uses a perspectivist approach that he calls &amp;lsquo;referential legitimation&amp;rsquo; Through competition, borrowings, identifications, and syncretisms, religion gets recgonized as religion by its religious peers Agrees with the Durkheimian point of view that religion is a response to crisis, contingency and the limits of human capacities, and the sacrality of society is of limited generalizability.</description>

I originally started in 2020, when I applied to attend as a non-degree student at the Hagop Kevorkian center.
Admitted and matriculated in the fall did stuff over covid covid actually helped out in finding spare time to take classes two years later, I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten all my classes down did summer classes at SOAS and a class at CUNY GC knocked out some requirements in two years, now spending the third year wrapping up my thesis in Iraq </description>

Early Islamic scholars placed an absolute cap on the # of dinars for zakat abu ubyad says differently schools maliki - houses vary, as long as there is no surplus, zakat can be given hanbali - same as above hanafi - strict cap, cannot exceed an absolute amount of wealth al-shafi&amp;rsquo;i - argues for an adjustable cost of living concept ma&amp;rsquo;ruf - what is known shafi applies this to zakat poses the question whether zakat based charity systems, based off of social birth, actually serve to maintain the status quo </description>

Scaling laws are one big unsolved problem in machine learning, and especially NLP. NLP hits the sweet spot where the problems are hard enough to still require ongoing research, but problems are also easy enough to have real practical applications, so the field continues to get funded. One problem some people have raised is the idea of a &amp;ldquo;mesa optimizer&amp;rdquo;, or a model that has learned a generic way of solving a task that may not be directly what you expect.</description>

What is a metastable failure? distributed systems
Metastable failures occur in open systems with an uncontrolled source of load where a trigger causes the system to enter a bad state that persists even when the trigger is removed. key to metastable failures is the sustaining feedback loop, rather than the trigger grey failures - https://blog.acolyer.org/2017/06/15/gray-failure-the-achilles-heel-of-cloud-scale-systems/ Examples of metastable failure

Mexico city is sinking and having floods
Engineers like Nabor Carillo understood the sinking was not natural, the rapidly growing city had extracted so much groundwater using mechanical pumps and delpleted the groundwater
Clay shrunk and the city sunk, in spite of the Grand Canal that drained the city&amp;rsquo;s lakes and allowed for expansion
Engineers after 1951 moved the groundwater wells out of the city center and towards urban periphery + deep drainage tunnels called Deep Drainage System (Sistema del Drenaje Profundo)</description>

Question 1 How can we understand the scope of nationalism today: as an ideology, community, political formation, legal entity, etc. In what ways nationalism continues to be important in the Middle East? This question is based on our readings during the ﬁrst week, and as an overarching theme. You are encouraged to discuss historical or contemporary case studies from the Middle East. Outline Notions of nationalism contribute to the strife percieved in the middle east Primordial nationalists believe that there is a fundalmental primordial cause to the sectarianism Nationalism affects the middle east by both the views imposed on it from an outside powers, but also shapes the middle east via capitalistic lens It shapes the goals of nations and their political futures Iraq&amp;rsquo;s roundabout with prime ministers that are satisfactorially Iranian and western friendly Nationalism from within Nationalism as an symbolism/socialpolitical movement Palestine, Kurds Emphasis on cultural gestation Nationalism as a legal entity (as a doctrine of the nation/ideaology) Lebanon, Iraq Nationalism from outside Primordialism Centrality of states Nationalism as engagement with international law Similar to the ottoman states engaging with international law in the ottoman twilight period, engagement with international law is a goal for nationalism, in effect having their lack &amp;ldquo;non-nation&amp;rdquo; state recongized among peers Draft outline What is nationalism?</description>

Question 1 Nationalism today must be defined within the Middle East as two broad components: a more &amp;ldquo;traditional&amp;rdquo; inner component derived from the nation-state, and another outer component derived from the modern empires of the world. Anthony Smith defines nationalism as &amp;ldquo;language and symbolism, a sociopolitical movement and an ideology of the nation&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo; (Smith, 7). The component is easily observable within the Middle East, as contemporary nations within the region offer a wide range of examples speaking to each aspect that Smith describes.</description>

      <description>Introduction Works relating to constructivist approaches to nationalism has left much to be desired with regards to the contemporary role of religion. These works typically focus on religion as a component of nationalism in the construction of a state, managed by the state, or empowering sectarian identities. Using Hinnebusch&amp;rsquo;s three tiered model of nationalism, consisting of supra-state, state-level, and sub-state actors, I propose that analysis of religion confined to a single stratum does not fully explain the power and integration of religion, especially in regards with supra-state nationalism.</description>

How does nationalism develop within the context of the post-Ottoman state?
Are there differences in ascribing &amp;lsquo;christian vs muslim&amp;rsquo; developments of nationalism?
Is there a &amp;ldquo;historical outsider&amp;rdquo;? We focus on outsiders remaining within a singular homogenous time, but can nationalisms be formed within different times?</description>

intro Motivating question: can neural network methods do anything that resembles compositional semantics?
What&amp;rsquo;s our metric? How do we know we&amp;rsquo;ve accomplished a goal? also sometimes called recongizing textual entailment (rte) - same as nli
example: premise -&amp;gt; hypothesis, does the premise entail the hypothesis?
Ido Dagan 05
We say that T entails H, if typically, a human reading T would infer that H is most likely true</description>

Capitalization affects how models perform (we&amp;rsquo;ve seen this at work)
Normalization definitely affects how models perform, but most arabic models already normalize (camel, Zampieri et al: SemEval-2020 Task 12: Multilingual Offensive Language Identiﬁcation in Social Media (OffensEval 2020)), etc.
What are we losing with normalizing? What are we losing with case folding?
https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/capitalizationcase-folding-1.html NER and entity linking Preprocessing is normalizing and reducing casing without much thought increases the consistency of the output by reducing the search space, but has the problem of losing potential context example: spongbob text encodes sentiment this becomes more problematic with arabic, since diacritziation actually has meaning arabizi et al Draft Currently, most natural langauge processing models have a pre-processing stage, where the text itself is cleaned up, before feeding into the model.</description>

why nyc? bad amenities, expensive, quarantine makes all cities the same nyc offers the rare coin of possability proust - see the same thing with a thousand eyes, not a thousand things with one eye find voices that are not similar to yours, but resound and cancel with yours think about the friends i&amp;rsquo;ve made: journalists, fruit vendors, tech workers, musicians, artists, activsts, grad students, researchers, video people, actors, refugees, etc friend&amp;rsquo;s stories about drinking rose at 9am, attending orthodox christmas while car repairs, hopping on motor bikes while coming back from city island, it&amp;rsquo;s not that new york&amp;rsquo;s stories are more diverse, but rather new york&amp;rsquo;s stories are more accessible nyc&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;cultural&amp;rdquo; experiences are not super unique, one could probably find facsination with any museum or art location, any place&amp;rsquo;s history can be plumbed infinitely for facsination (also the food) nyc both offers what you can do right now, but always offers the ability to one thing for me to tell the story of muhammad, another to tell the story of your telling of the story of muhammad nyc is not just a catalogue of what you have done, but also what other people have done finding flavored arak on the street nyc is not great because of these experiences, but it is great because it so readily offers up the choice to see these resources nyc invites you to its drama that contains an entire history of voices look beyond what it sells (pizza, bec, andrew yang, etc etc) not the raw number of people, but the density + variety of people not just the product of things produced, but also the the people producing it incompleteness, hard for you to take yourself out of it more than notions of chutzpah and &amp;ldquo;making it&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;hustling&amp;rdquo; people orginate what they cannot finish, and the uniqueness of this city is that it builds upon it Draft Quarantine has a weird way of making you apprechiate New York City.</description>

Benefit of college is not the content, but the free space to let your ideas ruminate Slowness without burnout polymath without dilettante
Draft this post is far more rambling than my regular ones
It&amp;rsquo;s been a year. Normally I&amp;rsquo;d write up something wrapping up about my goals and how far I accomplished, but I think for me this year was one long lesson in understanding the difference between being a dilettante and a polymath.</description>

Matt Might stated that computer programmers tend to optimize for the discrete past the point of usefulness. Random stuff, each new piece of technology is a shiny gadget. Even worse is the intention of only using old gadgets to retrofit and quanitfy each part of our lives Notes Nov 13th, 2022 Re-visiting this, it&amp;rsquo;s important to think about how it&amp;rsquo;s usually easier to see discrete things than continous ones.</description>

what is the stuff you can see, what is the stuff you can kick?

A system can have multiple states of equilibrium. Which equilibrium it reaches is a function of how it got there.
hystersis loop -&amp;gt; dependence on the state of a system with memory, the state of a system does not merely depend on the external fcators, but rather also depends on how it got there. This implies there are multiple equilibrium states.
Is this related to ddr? Are reintegration a function of only external actors, or does the implementation matter?</description>

Summary Talks about how human annotations and disagreements from those are not derived from statistical noise More context does not necessarily mean more agreement, once the input reaches sentence/passage, disagreements hold relatively steady We assume what people write is what they mean, but actually there&amp;rsquo;s a pretty big gap between what people mean &amp;lt;-&amp;gt; what they write &amp;lt;-&amp;gt; what they interpret &amp;lt;-&amp;gt; what they infer.</description>

This post is intended to help out any other students who are trying to get a grasp on the field of disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration (DDR) and security sector reform (SSR). I&amp;rsquo;ve found it quite difficult to get a good orientation on the field, especially coming into it barefaced.
Starting Out https://www.unddr.org/ - UN DDR guidelines Basically the center of this, the UN truly lies at the center of DDR and SSR efforts.</description>

Most skills aren&amp;rsquo;t transferrable, nor are they that useful beyond the context of the single project So, selfishly, I tend to think this way: if 90% of what I’m doing today won’t help me in the next job, then I should either reduce that 90% (for example, by focusing on general-purpose ideas, systems, abstractions, technologies), just not care as much about that 90% (as I used to), or find a job where I’m willing to sacrifice that 90% of my time because I think the cause is really important or the money is so&amp;hellip; Signoff/buyin meetings are useless.</description>

Notes Taqwim al-Nil (DiCapua - Gatekeepers of the Arab Past) is a sign of this type of modernizing thinking Argument: The construction of the Aswan Low/High Dams, alongside the Hindiya and Kut barrages, was a time of technomodernity that ultimately failed to respect the locals. Construction of the Aswan Low Dam would &amp;ldquo;modernize&amp;rdquo; the locals Construction of the Hindiya barrage would Kut Barrage Constructed in 1934, opened in 1939</description>

      <description>Tags: classes, Post Ottoman Near East
Abstract The opening of the Aswan Low Dam in 1902, as well as the Aswan High Dam in 1960 in Egypt has drawn significant scholarship in modernization theory and environmental history. Notions of modernity within Egyptian society were debated about within the context of both the Low and High dams. Yet curiously little is written about the dams of Iraq, specifically the Hindiya Barrage, opened in 1913, and the Kut Barrage, opened in 1939.</description>

Postgres Issues VACUUM Proposals have been made to try to relocate rows on the fly, but it’s hard to do correctly and risks bloating the indexes, since each row moved requires a new entry in each index to point to the new location of the row.

Describes the case studies of el salvador, mozambique, cambodia, bosnia, and somalia in the context of un peacekeeping operations
Battleground for how the conflict is presented on an international level Somalia was the first time the UN was authorized to use force in a peacekeeping mission Budgetary issues tends to lead missions towards short term management Deployments outside of Europe tend to have firm end dates Electoral politics is used as a landmark for UN security council Sometimes the UN has engaged in direct authority, such as Cambodia, East Timor, and Kosovo 794 Resolution: Military force under humanitarian purposes SC members are often more okay with intervening in places where the state no longer exists than trample on soverighty for fear of precedence Superimposing of east/west and urban/rural on local conflcits International Communities How the international community defines a crisis is important0 Permanent SC members play a role in this SC matintains discretion over what is and is not an emergency lack of consensus leads to common denominator type mandates Deployments are most often partial and reinforced by patrolling teams, which limits their scope Different staff members (civpols, civs, military) are treated differently civs least likely to have contact with local memebers military is most visible, but often limited police are often not numerous enough Urban/rural divide exasterbated by the UN staff, UN staff take over a capital but are raely seen in towns Various Faces of Local Populations Blue helments often consider two parties: a &amp;ldquo;military&amp;rdquo; and a &amp;ldquo;political&amp;rdquo; one This division is often nonexistent Peace agreements do not create peace, but give a map for who the UN will negotiate with Absense such agreements, parties vie to become recongized as the negotiating parter of the UN, such as in Somalia Local actors are not monoliths, they also evolve when the UN injects itself Political actors who do not play the military game or hardball the UN often get marginalized Bosnia&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;civil&amp;rdquo; parties were shut out by 3 extreme viewpoints Returnees from exile also pose unique sets of questions Peace process sharpens the differences between the leaders and their constituants Indigenous Civil Societies UN usually takes a very passive view of civilians &amp;ldquo;refugee&amp;rdquo; idea, or &amp;ldquo;oppresive state&amp;rdquo; UN actors look for structure of &amp;ldquo;civil society&amp;rdquo; that mirror the ones in the west ngo, trade unions, etc UN predominately interacts with Human rights orgs Typically benefits diaspora Both UN staff and local NGOs feel the other is difficult to work with UN has massive NIH syndrome as a result IGNO&amp;rsquo;s are perceived to be favored by the UN UN often assumes distinct &amp;ldquo;political&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;civil&amp;rdquo; realms El Savador had Human rights NGO&amp;rsquo;s, but as a result of the civil conditions, these NGO&amp;rsquo;s inherently favored some politicans False impression of &amp;ldquo;intellectuals&amp;rdquo; as unbiased mediators Community interaction in rural vs urban areas Strict top/down interpreations are wrong, communities constantly renegotiate their position Religious actors play a special role UN often drawn into local political disputes Religious actors are mobilizing capacity in wars Local employees as brokers Missions w/ admin that have pressure exterted on them as UN employees Foreign language knowledge biases the background Information trading from local employees for future posts Peacekeepers &amp;amp; local socities &amp;ldquo;Peace is not self evident&amp;rdquo; Ambiguity between UN and local cultures provides space for political entrepenurs &amp;ldquo;Blood &amp;amp; BOne: Kinship in Somali society&amp;rdquo; Local actors perceive social change for power, UN sees it as waging for reference ideas &amp;ldquo;Rule of law&amp;rdquo; is particularly thorny Locals often see the gov as &amp;ldquo;not for them&amp;rdquo;, and the UN missions in the same way &amp;ldquo;Law&amp;rdquo; as a concept is not widely respected Do locals describe the state as they describe the UN mission?</description>

Week 1 Hegel et al., Phenomenology of Spirit. Dialects between the master and slave Master requires the slave to recongize him as the master, whereas the slave later derives self worth from their labor, which then leads to a more developed conciousness of self for the slave The master/slave distinction is caused because two recongize that each other is required to distinguish the self, and from that, the one who chooses to value life over death becomes weaker, and therefore the slave Fanon notes that this dialectic is not complete for the colonial, the colonized often end up mimicking the colonizers, which does not lead to a more developed conciousness of the self not to mention the colonizer becomes brutalized in the process, which suggests that there is more development that the simple dialectic gives Kant, “AN ANSWER TO THE QUESTION: WHAT IS ENLIGHTENMENT?</description>

Outline Starting point: The Community as a system wrt Iraqi Militias Draft: master&amp;rsquo;s thesis
Concept Communities are often held as the crucial center for deradicalization and reintegration programs. For the context of Iraqi Militias/Hashd al-Shaabi/PMF, what does this look like? How can communities foster peacebuilding within this context? Baselines Terrorism &amp;ldquo;deradicalization&amp;rdquo; vs DDR vs refugee reintegration Is the difference between terrorism &amp;ldquo;deradicalization&amp;rdquo; and militia reintegration a purely judicial/jurisprudence one?</description>

Kube API basics
Core responsbilities serve the Kube API -&amp;gt; reading/manipluating state, usually in etcd proxy cluster components HTTP Interface http interface provides 4 structures:
Kinds Type of entity, each object has a kind usually 3 categories of kinds objects -&amp;gt; a persistent entity within the system lists -&amp;gt; 1 or more kinds special purpose -&amp;gt; for special actions, like status API Group collection of kinds that are logically related like /apis/core Version each API group can (and likely does) exist as multiple versions All objects are either in one API version or none Resource lowercase, plural word that identifies a set of HTTP endpoints usually sends and receives a single kind can have subrouses, usually implemented with custom HTTP protocols like websockets always corresponds to an HTTP path GVR and GVK Group Version Resource (GVR) Uniquely identifies a HTTP path Group Version Kind (GVK) what a GVR returns Special Notes api/v1 exists outside of apis as a legacy holdover, should be apis/core/v1 cluster wide entities have different values, such as /metrics, /logs, and /healthz specs vs status specifications - desired state for a resource status - observed state for a resource API server internals Each API group has a specific handler, and there are 6 different phases internally</description>

Talks about how people cope with complexity in power plants
Decision models: Take some data, integrate the data, evaluate and make a decision, and coordinate the acts with an intention in mind Simple heuristics taken: Thresholds - when a variable crosses an absolute threshold Like a threshold in grafana - &amp;ldquo;IO wait in CPU usage occupying more than 50%, I know that the CPU is spending time waiting on IO, resolution is involved with IO&amp;rdquo; Deviation from normal - when an experienced operator knows what is normal and what is not Deviation from normal - &amp;ldquo;current time is outside of p99&amp;rdquo; Abstraction Hierarchies Physical form relates to the abstract function, which relates to the general understanding</description>

https://www.instapaper.com/read/1303612550 Logical paradox about the scientific method:
If a raven is black, and your hypothesis is that &amp;ldquo;ravens are black&amp;rdquo;, then every raven you see that is black supports the hypothesis However, the cohort of this is that &amp;ldquo;if a thing is a raven, then it is black&amp;rdquo; This means that non-raven non-black things support the hypothesis, which is nuts So inherently there is a ranking of evidence, not non-raven non-black things are weaker evidence than a black raven A la bayesian inference However, baysesian inference requires you to know the rough % of non-black non-ravens to black ravens, This number can be estimated, but where is it from?</description>

Chapter 1 Dawa was modeled after the muslim brotherhood Largely driven underground by Saddam Born out of young clerics from najaf in 1959-1960, elders adopted a mostly quietest stance Born out of a desire to drive back communism&amp;rsquo;s appeal Originally cross-sectarian Muhammad Baqir as-Sadr wrote the treatises that became the core Presented Hegel/Marx with Islam as a viable alternative to communism and capitalism Musa Sadr (BIL and older cousin to Baqir) founded the amal movement in lebanon 3 Sadr&amp;rsquo;s fostered people conversant in Marxism to promote Islam Dawa armed uprising in 1977 Split into exiles in lebanon, iran, and the west Chapter 2 nouri al-maliki Not from a clerical family largely middle tier functionary between 2003-2006 Captapulted into the scene by Khalizad Maliki&amp;rsquo;s ascendence set against the backdrop of the al-Qaeda bombing in Samarra Muqtada al-Sadr withdrew his ministers in 2007 following the troop surge Maliki survived with a coalition of Shia and Kurdish parties Mahidi and Barzani attempted to secure a no-confidence vote, but could not get the green light from Iran or the US August 2007 Sadrist militias attached solders guarding the Imam Hussein Shrine in Kerbala Maliki&amp;rsquo;s response garnered him immense popular support Shia militias in 2007 broke out into civil war Especially over control of basra March 24, 2008 - Maliki begins the &amp;ldquo;Charge of the Knights&amp;rdquo; offensive in basra April 5, 2008 - Sunni and Kurdish political parties throw their weight behind Maliki instead of the Muqtada al-Sadr&amp;rsquo;s party, political and military victory followed May 20, 2008 - Sadrists capitualted to Iraq army&amp;rsquo;s occupation of Sadr city Kut captured from Sadrists in March Amarra captured in June Ultimately broke the Sadrist control of the South Chapter 3 sahwa (awakening) movement started in 2006 and spread in 2007 Maliki applied the same principals in 2008 to the shia community Set roundtable for shia tribal leaders Jan 2009 provincial elections Stunning defeat for the 2005 political class Foreshadowed the 2010 elections Maliki negotiated the withdraw of US troops from cities in 2009, used it as a talking point August 19, 2009 - al-Qaeda conducts a large bombing in finance and foreign ministries within the gz (green zone) October 26, 2009 - al-Qaeda stages even larger attack in GZ, kills over 600 Iraqis March 2010 - Intensive intra-Shia competition for votes leading up the elections Maliki&amp;rsquo;s base was largely middle-class or lower middle class voters Security situation of the GZ made other politicans depend on the Dawa for support Security apperatus of the state was folded into the Dawa 2011 - PM&amp;rsquo;s office sets up the &amp;ldquo;Office of Security and Information&amp;rdquo; Similar to Presidental Diwan under Saddam Also sets up the counterterrorism burea, giving Malki control of the special forces Judge Medhat al-Mahmoud&amp;rsquo;s favorable rulings granted maliki significant power Rival political leaders also did not oppose the centralization of the state Chapter 4: The Shia Supremists badr Corps and islamic supreme council of iraq (isci) returned the same time to Iraq Largely did Iran&amp;rsquo;s bidding Hunted down former pilots of the Iraqi Air Force, lead to general asylum decree in Kurdistan SCIRI took over mosques in Baghdad Lead to the UIA in 2005 &amp;ldquo;Sanctioned&amp;rdquo;

Interim PM Jafari inducted hundreds of Badr Security officiers into ministry of interior in 2005 Post 2005 Sunnis were largely driven out of the city 2004-2005 large scale sectarian cleansing Maliki used the health ministry and other governing bodies to be complicit in this Feb 2006 - Oct 2007 - UN HCR estimates 1MM baghdadis became IDP&amp;rsquo;s Chapter 5: The Sunni Chauvists Saddam embraced Sunni points in early 1990&amp;rsquo;s to shore up support Iraqi Islamic Party Offshoot that disagreed with Saddam&amp;rsquo;s binding of Sunnism and the state Later asked the Brotherhood to help for a resistance organization against Saddam in 1979-1980 Worked with occasional other politics groups, like the Dawa Saddam developed a Salafi opposition to the brotherhood, binding the Baa&amp;rsquo;th and Salafism Saddam&amp;rsquo;s plans laid the groundwork for an insurgency Funding was also provided by Bashar al-Assad 2005 elections US wanted to capture Fallujah and Mosul before elections Sunnis boycotted the elections Major blunder, did an about face in Dec 2005, assuming Sunnis were majority of pop Return to violence after they did not get their desired results 3 senior sunni politicians wanted to break the gov from within: Khalaf Ulayan Mahmoud al-Mashadani Adnan al-Dulaimi Zarqawi caused a rift in the Sunni insurgency Accelerated with the Samar bombing IS produced a three-pronged backlash Awakening Rift b/tw other jihadi groups growing population revolution against al-Qaeda in 2007 2008 elections Awakening movement grew into a political party in Anbar Saleh al-Mutlaq &amp;amp;

[1] I. Reader and J. Shultz, Pilgrims Until We Die: Unending Pilgrimage in Shikoku, 1st ed. Oxford University Press, 2021. doi: 10.1093/oso/9780197573587.001.0001.
Notes Focuses on how eternal pilgrimage is understudied
Linkages to karbala and people there, performing mowkebs as a ritual
Uses the idea of &amp;ldquo;permanent pilgrims&amp;rdquo;
“We argue that Shikoku should be seen not as a unique outlier but as a manifestation of a potentially recurrent phenomenon, but one that has been rather overlooked in pilgrimage studies—namely repetition, long-term, temporally unbound, and unending pilgrimage engagement.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m entering my sixth year of programming this year, and like any developer, you begin to have all sorts of thoughts. This is a loose collection of major lessons I&amp;rsquo;ve learned throughout the past five years. Funnily enough, I think most of this is not directly teachable, the majority of these lessons I&amp;rsquo;ve arrived at by failing over and over.
Outage Driven Development I&amp;rsquo;ve worked at two startups and one large company, and one of the startups was a cloud metrics company, so I&amp;rsquo;ve seen my fair share of outages.</description>

Week 2 reading response The competing narratives of secularization this week seem to be akin to blind men reaching for the elephant: each individual feels a different part, and tends project their understanding off of such. Taylor, for example, begins with by introducing the concept of &amp;ldquo;closed world system&amp;rdquo;, which is a relatively beign rehashing of the concept of a &amp;ldquo;closed form solution&amp;rdquo;. Taylor tells us that there exists internally consistent models whose abstractions may not map distinctly to the real world, yet these imperfect models are still widely adopted and lived in different ways.</description>

From Wiley-Blackwell Companions to Religion: The Blackwell Companion to Religion and Violence Grassroots activism is the interpretive locus of religious peacebuilding. According to Lederach, grassroots peacebuilding “means that the location of the actor and action is among the poor, the affected communities who … understand survival and change in terms of decades and generations, in terms of lifelong processes of transformation” (2003b: 262, 264). The introduction to the book Peacemakers in Action asserts that “today, it is widely accepted that religion is a cause-rather than a solution – to many of the world&amp;rsquo;s violent conflicts.</description>

Large part of historical problems - cannot tell who is formally enrolled as a hashd member Some people claim to be under hashd, not formally authorized by the hashd comission patchwork entry process and unification lead to this ambigious membership asa&amp;rsquo;ib ahl al-haqq (aah) and kataib hezbollah (kh) were already active, along with sons of iraq Jan 2020 - &amp;gt;160,000 members of the hashd according to abu ali al-basri/adnan ibrahim al-najjar Fighter Registration Initial registration started in late 2014 and was on temporary rolling contracts Hashd fighters had no clear expectation of permanent employments Volunteers were haphazardly placed into units, with little influence, units would take new volunteers Initially 90 day contracts no ID cards or biometrics - iraqi ghost militias registration windows swapped constantly between reigstered and unregistered salaries were often distributed and redistrubted between registered and unregistered fighters unit commanders had almost complete discretion on how to disburse the money with few accountability often 30% skimmed on salaries as &amp;ldquo;unit funds&amp;rdquo; Right-sizing and Auditing 2016 - ~122k registered with maybe 40-50k unregistered haider al-abadi wanted to audit all claimed registered individuals and record names and personal identification hawiyah shahadat al-jinsiya bataqat al-sakan al-tamwiniya also biometrics (photos and fingerprints) abadi ended up failing twice 2018 - hashd finance director qassim dahif al-zubaidi assassinated may 12, 2018 - iraqi election law actually requires security forces to vote before the public does (so that they can be on site to preotect the elections), but the hashd voted the same time as the public in theri own bases Biometrics Iraqi gov slowly moving towards a tawtin al-rawatib (&amp;ldquo;settling of salaries&amp;rdquo; -&amp;gt; automated payment system) idea was to distrupt the commander based disembursement model March 25, 2019 - hussein ismail khalil announces fingerprinting and enrolled 80k/160k by March 2019 many hashd still paid with cash, those with widows and disabilities are testing electronic payment system qi cards payments are still authorized by the hashd commission Registered and Unregistered Large gulf between units in terms of registered/unregistered #&amp;rsquo;s kataib hezbollah (kh) and badr control the key administrative posts hisham al-hashimi states that around 24k unregistered people were serving in the hashd, or ~17.</description>

Here&amp;rsquo;s a list of infrastructure technologies I&amp;rsquo;ve worked with in the past two years:
grpc kubernetes istio envoy kubeflow kfserving etcd rabbitmq redis kyoto tycoon cassandra hbase postgres haproxy solr kafka pulsar zookeeper consul These are loosely organized since each of the technologies do multiple things. Looking back on this, it&amp;rsquo;s a little absurd that this is the case. There&amp;rsquo;s far too much going on here, and I think I&amp;rsquo;m not out of the ordinary for programmers in usage of these tools.</description>

Any digital modulation, and more so encryption, would be the responsibility of the ground stations. This is still a common design pattern for satellites, referred to as the &amp;ldquo;bent pipe&amp;rdquo; model since the space segment is merely a &amp;ldquo;bend&amp;rdquo; with no logic, but it is subject to abuse by unauthorized operators so there&amp;rsquo;s usually some degree of at least authentication today.</description>

Scaling Laws for Acoustic Models papers: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.09488.pdf how do acoustic models scale with model size? maybe ask haoran on this? https://assets.amazon.science/ef/a6/60f65ed543c9af2a519caba269bd/scaling-laws-for-acoustic-models.pdf what proposals are there? what does the current field look like for scaling laws? most models use asr + LM&amp;rsquo;s now, how does this scale with it overall?zz does wav2vec scale? what are the profiles for wer in terms of longer speech datasets?</description>

Summary There is no logical spatial, or chronological, limit to the ‘War on Terror’. Complete opposite of Anderson&amp;rsquo;s imagined communities Yet in the West’s contemporary conflicts people’s reception of events, including battles, through the lens of their personal experience does matter to the conflict’s outcome. Why? Why do personal experiences matter here, when we tend to percieve things as part of a giant neoliberal machine?

Related Related to Nagel, Ferran - Politics of Religion and Nationalism
Summary Religion and nationalism can be carved into 3 sections:
Civil-Religious Religious Nationalism Secular Nationalism Can further be divided into stable and unstable components
Introduction Model Religion-state ideological links Religion-state institutional links Secular nationalism Weak to nonexistent Separation Religious nationalism Strong (with a particular group) Multiple religion-state contacts (to a particular group) Civil-religious nationalism Supportive (to religion in general) Benign separation or pluralistic accomodation Launa of studies when it comes to nationalism and religion Historically Modenrists focus their attention on the role of language, the print media, and educational system Gellner notes &amp;ldquo;curious fact&amp;rdquo; about nations and religion Westphalian system subordinates religion to the state iraq&amp;rsquo;s westphalian system continues with this to today Secular nationalism replaced ethnic and religious identity for national identity based on civic and secular norms friendly &amp;ldquo;takeover&amp;rdquo; of religion by nationalism &amp;ldquo;Post-colonial states like india and turkey aggressively forged secular nationalism&amp;rdquo; Walzer notes that the revival of religion in algeria, india, and israel represents rejection of secular nationalism ireland has strong religious identity &amp;ldquo;secular nationalism presumes the triumph of national over religious identity&amp;rdquo; - pg 8 &amp;ldquo;civil religious nationalism is rooted in the country&amp;rsquo;s religious experience, but nevertheless develops separately from it&amp;rdquo; falls short in capturing every regime &amp;ldquo;Religious nationalism can occur when religious groups are socially and politically strong and have some degree of institutional autonomy&amp;rdquo; - pg 15 bosnia has this, where lack of religious accomodation has lead to the rise of religious identities Religion and state are not static, their discourses change over time &amp;ldquo;We hypothesize that members of the majority faith are likely to express pro-nationalist sentiments in states with religious nationalism as its model, though this archetype runs the danger of alienating minority faiths&amp;rdquo; - pg 29 united states: Stable Civil-Religious Nationalism US was founded by a mixed group of christians, sects varying wildly US constitution specifices the relationship of state and gov Gov does not interfere with religion, which allows them to spread No anticlerical revolution like in france US cares about being &amp;ldquo;generically&amp;rdquo; religious, not specifically the sect US religious identity has morphed, adopting Jews and Catholics along the way Religious groups were far more likely to support the Iraq war Evanglicals especially israel: Unstable Civil-Religious Nationalism Israel&amp;rsquo;s founding brought together Zionists and Jews of all stripes Failed to adopt a constitution, leaving the Basic Law Ambiguity of the Basic Law has lead differing interpretations of religion and the state Ben Gurion was not particularly religious and more socialist, but various different leaders have taken tacks Ultra-Orthodox jews even reject the Zionist project Political Zionism vs cultural Zionism vs Revisionism vs theological Zionism Deeply debated in Israeli society, balance of power in the Knesset has been razor thin, which puts Zionists at the kingmaker role Zionists more likely to favor state aid to settlements greece: Stable Religious Nationalism Greence has long history with religion, founding of the state from ottoman empire has revisionist tendencies about the role of the orthodox church Church hailed as the savior of faith under ottoman rule Similar to other Balkan states, described in Anscombe - State, Faith, and Nation Orthodox Church has very heavy input on educational policy Most Greeks see religion as an important part of their identity Colors their views on Greece/Turkey relations, especially after the 1934 population exchanges malaysia: Unstable Religious Nationalism Constitution theoritically coded towards Islam, although in general is not Recent leaders have attempted to appeal to native Malays and Islam, against Indian and Chinese minorities Most native Malays very poor, Chinese tend to be urban and rich, Indians somewhere in between Constitution amendments does privilage Malays to some extent Rukun Negara was meant to harmonize these changes Hostility to China is not a major change among religions, except Christianity Malaysia forcing established Islam onto the state towards powerful minorities has dangerous ramificiations uruguay: Stable Secular Nationalism Relatively backwater among Catholics during Spanish rule Had large anticlerical moment Most people not religious, and stable because the religious base was never built up against the state india: Unstable Secular Nationalism Powerful religious actors at the construction of the state Indira Ghdani and Rajiv Ghandi both spoke about secularism, but appealed to Hindu nationalism when needed bharatiya janata party (bjp) largely appeals to Hindu nationalism Secularism has appeal on the national discourse level, BJP attempts to mix Hindu identity with an Indian one Normative values of secularism being overriden by powerful religious actors goes against the idea that with time, a secular state imposed from top down will secularize the population </description>

Rather, you will try to learn as efficiently as possible so you can quickly get to the point where actual open questions arise, as these are the only questions worth writing about.
Key takeaways: make fleeting notes and project notes, review the fleeting notes and file the project notes accordingly. Fleeting notes should be for when things pop into your mind, although I somewhat use things for this purpose as well.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s about modling the subject, and divination&amp;rsquo;s usefuless is breaking out of the low energy wells that you find yourself trapped in but do not have the correct incentive structures to escape.
Why divination? Take particulary paths and reach for less casual identitives
Semi-random systems can often appear to be random but true randomless is quite difficult
On molding the subject and randomness, the goal of randomness is that it has two opposite effects: it can help continue molding the subject by speeding up processess of belief, but it can also serve to dislodge abstractions</description>

      <description>Chapter 5: Naming an identifier is one that is: referring to at most one entity referred to by at most one identifier always referring to the same entity (no-reuse) an address is a single access point can be reused can be reassigned cannot be reused as an identifier oftentimes name-to-address bindings are done by creating a (name, address) table you can create a self-certifying name by hashing the name, that way the name can always be guarneteed to be the data flat naming - when we don&amp;rsquo;t want the name to give any information about how to locate the access point of an entity Ways of Transmitting Names broadcasting names broadcasting or multicasting is difficult to implement efficiently in large-scale networks broadcast a message to each machine regarding the location of an entity and allow every machine to check if it has knowledge about that entity extremely inefficient as network grows somewhat mitgated by gossip protocols forwarding pointers chains introduce performance problems and are susceptible to broken links when an entity moves from A to B, it leaves behind a reference in A about where its going chains for highly mobile entities can become very long example: SSP Chains SSP chains are forwarding pointers implemented with a (client stub, server stub) pair a server stub contains either a local reference to the actual object or a local reference to a remote client stub for that object whenever an object moves from A to B, it leaves behind a client stub in A, and sets up a server stub in B.</description>

      <description>Tags: problems and methods, economics
Neoliberalism and neoliberalization are two topics that barely need introduction. Neoliberal policies affect everday lives of most people across the world. Neoliberalization the process, broadly identified to be coincident with the rise of the Bretton Woods institutions and the dominance of a globalized financial system, has faced dramatic upheaval since the fall of the Soviet Union. No introduction to these topics is possible without mentioning Francis Fukyama&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;The End of History?</description>

      <description>Introduction \doublespacing The rise of the self-declared &amp;ldquo;Islamic State&amp;rdquo; (IS) in Iraq, and the humiliating defeat of the Iraqi Security Forces (ISF) in Mosul in 2014 acted as a forcing function for the formation of the Hashd al-Shaabi, or the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF). With over 100,000 mobilized and 40 different armed groups of all stripes united under this banner, the PMF played a pivotal role in countering the offensive by IS, ultimately leading to the liberation of Mosul in 2017 and its declared defeat in 2018.</description>

Book: Gambetta, Diego, and Heather Hamill. Streetwise: How Taxi Drivers Establish Customer’s Trustworthiness, 2005
Taxi drivers pre-ridesharing days had a pretty wild list of signs to watch. Among these, a driver looked at:
Age (older vs younger) Gender (women vs men) Race (&amp;ldquo;white&amp;rdquo; vs &amp;ldquo;black&amp;rdquo;) Spanish over other ethnic groups (if the driver was Spanish) Group size (individual vs multiple groups) Wealth (wealthier vs poorer) Known passengers over strangers Callers over hailers Catholic over Protestant if the driver is Catholic Self-absorbed over inquisitive Candid over shifty Friendly and calm over aggressive/agitated All of these are captured in Diego Gambetta and Heather Hamill&amp;rsquo;s book Streetwise: How Taxi Drivers Establish Customer Trustworthniess.</description>

Takeaway: financial advice is generalized because finance is a weird field, software has much more acute learning signals. Finance models are generically not generalizable, no one would apply black-scholes towards their groceries.
Advice should be taken on how easily something can be abstracted or whether the problem is domain specific. Some patterns applied in firmware and SDR cannot be applied to higher level programming, for example.</description>

[Transformers|Deep Neural Networks|AI] need to be explainable is a common enough refrain. I would say it&amp;rsquo;s a fairly uncontroversial statement that NLP is a field heavy on the experimental and light on the theoretical. With that in mind, I want to talk about the concept of &amp;ldquo;information plane&amp;rdquo;, a term coined by Schwartz-Ziv and Tishby (2017). For Schwartz-Ziv and Tishby, the information plane is &amp;ldquo;the plane of the Mutual Information values that each layer preserves on the input and output variables&amp;rdquo;.</description>

interconnected criminal insurgencies where the global disenfranchised resist, co-opt, and route around states Cartels, traffickers, hackers, arms dealers, etc Plutocratic insurgency, global elites seek to disengage from traditional national obligations and responsbilities Libertarians, tax havens, currency speculators Neither insurgency wishes to seek the control over the state, nor destroy it. They both rely on the state to provide social welfare, but carve out zones of autonomy (like sez&amp;rsquo;s) to make profits.</description>

While there is significant literature on the passion plays (ta&amp;rsquo;ziyeh) of Iran, there is nearly no work about two specific aspects of the rituals: the liturgical orators known as radoods, and the processional chants known as radat.</description>

interesting finding of this paper is that they found larger models tended to generate more false answers possibly because larger models are better at imitating falsehoods, or they make more human like (but false) generalizations </description>

Peacekeeping is based on the trinity of consent, neutrality/impartiality and the use of force in self-defence.
Talks about how neutrality has been abandoned, but the impartailty of force should make up for it
Makes a clear distinction between a peacekeeping operation and a coercive peace enforcement action
However, the UN must mediate between actors, and in selecting the actors it inherently legitimizes by making them a party to the negotiations</description>

Mathematical statistics towards data analysis
Taking functional models more seriously than stochastic ones, as functional models are easier to verify, and scale better than stochastic ones (more data)
Not all answers is contained within the data
Hubris is the greatest danger that accompaniesformal data analysis, including formalized statistical analysis. The feeling of “Give me (or morelikely even, give my assistant) the data, and I will tell you what the real answer is!</description>

      <description>uruguay, drafts
Introduction I&amp;rsquo;ve been in Uruguay for 6 months now, so I figured I&amp;rsquo;d do a quick writeup of life here. I came to Uruguay initially because I had sort of seen it as a great break from Iraq, and also a little out of the beaten path. From a bureaucratic standpoint, Uruguay is one of the smoothest countries I&amp;rsquo;ve ever lived in. From a food standpoint, I feel like I could take it or leave it.</description>

HID 6 Key Rollover Most keyboards actually support more, but cheap keyboards only implement the BIOS compatible subset, which is 6 key supported.
https://www.devever.net/~hl/usbnkro The USD HID is highly generic, uses a Report Descriptor that tells you the structure of the blob sent alongside it However, a keyboard can still implement the boot protocol and also provide NKRO. When a keyboard is powered, as per the HID specification, it defaults to using its own preferred reporting formats and can use NKRO-enabled input reports&amp;hellip; A common myth about USB keyboards is that they can only support 6-key rollover, and not report more than 6 keys being pressed at a time.</description>

Neoliberalism has this interesting way of making us all the fruit of the poisonous tree through its continual embedding of us as nodes within a massive graph. The condition of our existance is to be moving forward on this scale, blah blah, we&amp;rsquo;ve all heard this one a million times before1, 2, we&amp;rsquo;re all Mark Fisher 3 or working Graberian bullshit jobs4. The Bretton Woods institutions are extractive, foreign aid serves to financialize and create consumers in third world countries while having aid flow back, the continual labor of debt is not an enlightended individualism, but serves to render profitiability from people.</description>

      <description>Lebanon Many migrants suffer violence in a multitude of forms on their path to their ultimate destination. Along the way, observers categorize migrants between two poles: either the migrant as &amp;ldquo;refugee&amp;rdquo; or a migrant as an &amp;ldquo;economic migrant&amp;rdquo;. This dual classification, with significant grey area in between, affords people different rights and treatment along the way. The term &amp;ldquo;refugee&amp;rdquo; has legal standing in some countries and carries certain rights and access to international institutions, but implies a loss of agency.</description>

https://alpinefellowship.com/welcome __Question__: Does the wild stand in opposition to civilisation, or are they both manifestations of the natural? Is our conception of the wild anthropic, indeed is it sentimental? When is it right to ‘live according to nature’, and when should we turn to science to rewire nature or ourselves? Indeed, what is our ‘natural’ state? And following a year in which so much interaction has been online, we ask how it affects this theme?</description>

Are your muscles sore or are do they feel dead, heavy, and flat? In the first instance of soreness, this is caused by micro-tears in the muscles. In the second case, of dead legs, the neurological fatigue mentioned above or glycogen depletion are the primary culprits. - Training for the Uphill Athlete
You shouldn’t train like your favorite athlete or your friends, because there aren’t two identical people, and workouts don’t produce the same effect in two different bodies.</description>

Currently, worldwide food production exceeds 2,750 kilocalories per person per day [15], which exceeds the amount required to feed the global population. Although these data account for farm-level waste, they do not include the estimated 20% household food waste [44]. Hence, currently available calories are likely to be about 2,200 kilocalories per person per day, which is sufficient for the world’s current population [23].

Zwet, Erik van, and Eric Cator. “The Significance Filter, the Winner’s Curse and the Need to Shrink.” ArXiv:2009.09440 [Stat], September 20, 2020. http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.09440. &amp;ldquo;Signficance filter&amp;rdquo; means only focusing on statistically significant results, which means that it can lead to an overestimation of the magnitude of the parameter.
Attempts to study this from a bayesian perspective, shows that the
the relativebias of the magnitude is a decreasing function of the power and thatthe usual confidence interval undercovers when the power is less than50%.</description>
