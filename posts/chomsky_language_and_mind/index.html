<h2 id="linguistic-contributions-past-present-and-future">Linguistic Contributions - Past, Present, and Future</h2>
<ul>
<li>3 lectures by Chomsky</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="past">Past</h2>
<ul>
<li>19th and 20the centuries have had linguistics, philosophy, and psychology go their separate ways, the problem of the mind has served to link the disparate fields back together</li>
<li>Karl Lashley, 1948 - argued that underlying language use - and all organized behavior - must contain abstract mechanisms of some sort that are not analyzable in terms of association and could not be developed by simple means</li>
<li>Points that mental structures are not &ldquo;more of the same&rdquo;, but rather they are quality very different than the complex networks and structures that can be developed by scaling up
<ul>
<li>not just degree of complexity, but the quality of complexity</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Physics to Cartesian and Newton was not adequately grounded, since it still postulated the mystical force of gravity, just as Descartes’ postulation of the mind</li>
<li>Spanish physicians Juan Harte - Late 16th century, published about intelligence, which gives 3 levels: sensory, self-sustaining, and generative
<ul>
<li>this is the groundwork for the physchological theory that the use of language is a correct index of intelligence</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Descartes observed that even low level languages is totally unattainable by apes</li>
<li>However, this asks us, is reasoning generative of speech? Corvids, for example, can reason without speech</li>
<li>“Being unbounded and freed from stimulus control do not necessarily exceed the bounds of mechanical explanation&quot;
<ul>
<li>Chomsky begins to formulate the idea of computationally enumerable vs computationally finite</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>&ldquo;It seems to be that the most hopeful approach of today is to describle the phenomena of language and of mental activity as accurately as possible&rdquo; - pg 12
<ul>
<li>argues that we must stop attempting to link postulates with approaches, and read the behaviors for what they are</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Wilhelm von Humbolt - 1830’s - &ldquo;the speaker makes infinite use of finite means&rdquo;
<ul>
<li>Chomsky therefore says that the grammar must contain a finite system of rules that generates infinitely many deep and surface structures</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>talks about Port-Royal theory to modern structural and descriptive linguistics
<ul>
<li>latter restricts itself to the analysis of &ldquo;surface structure&rdquo; - formal properties that are explicit in the signal and to phrases and units that can be determined from the signal by techniques of segmentation and classification</li>
<li>Ferdinand de Saussure, at the turn of the century, stated that the only methods of linguistic analysis are segmentation and classification</li>
<li>syntagmatic (patterns in the literally succession in the stream of speech)</li>
<li>paradignmatic (relations among units that occupy the same position in the stream of speech)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
