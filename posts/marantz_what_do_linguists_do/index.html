          <h1>Marantz - What do linguists do?</h1>

          <p><a href="/posts/papers/">papers</a>, <a href="/posts/languages_lingustics/">languages/linguistics</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Syntax is at the core of generative grammar</li>
<li>sentences of a language as a sequence of units that re-occur
<ul>
<li>can be sounds, roughly represented by words (letters as a semiotic of sounds)</li>
<li>what separates a word salad (sentence with no meaning) and a sentence with meaning?</li>
<li>are human languages finite state languages, aka those generated from finite state grammars? - <a href="/posts/chomsky/">chomsky</a>
<ul>
<li>separators of phrases (commas and words) cannot be replaced without losing meaning, but we can insert additional phrases in between without losing original meaning</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>however, does chomsky operate on only made up sentences? We can infinitely nest variables and sentences, but does this map nicely back to human language?
<ul>
<li>which lends to a rules based analysis, but we can move beyond the rules based analysis and speakers can produce and understand sentences they haven&rsquo;t heard before
<ul>
<li>every finite corpus of setnences represents an accidental sampling of utterances</li>
<li>which means the rules can be used to project future sentences</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>do linguists largely predict data they don&rsquo;t have, based on rules they can&rsquo;t verify?</li>
<li>computational people vs linguists
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;linguistic enterprise is about the knowledge of language that underlies everything that a speaker does with their language&rdquo;</li>
<li>computational people typically have a very specific use case of language (e.g. parsing a web query)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>anthropology vs linguistics
<ul>
<li>what is the relationship between culture and language?</li>
<li>marantz argues that the language itself is a bad lens to analyze culture
<ul>
<li>for Piraha by Everett, Marantz thinks that culutral constraints cannot explain behavior that strictly adheres to the constraints, a study of cultural constraints requires you to think on the boundaries and what transgresses the constraints</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>argues that lingusits are cognitive neuroscientists, who operate at many levels of abstractions</li>
</ul>
