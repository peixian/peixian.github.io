For instance, it may have been critical to relations between various Ottoman officials and representatives of outside financial interests that the massive population shifts—due in part to violence induced by famines in Eastern Anatolia and Arabia, as well as the result of a defeat at the hands of Russia—became the primary focus of Ottoman state reforms. 11 Such momentary shifts surely undermined some bankers’ agendas as a consequence.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>This conflict in priorities becomes increasingly important when we understand how strife within communities over access to key resources, such as water, land, and fuel leaves the entire structure of imperial order even more confusing from the perspective of investors. That we are dealing with the introduction of refugees in those fragile spaces disrupted by war, compounded by the fact that the Ottoman government was in tremendous flux (partially in response to the refugee situation), reinforces the claim that we can usefully consider explaining much of the transitional era through the prism of itinerate Ottomans.
