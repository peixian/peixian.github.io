</li>
<li>Big differences between Arab Spring and 1970 Revolutions
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Lacked any associated intellectual anchor&rdquo; - pg 11</li>
<li>&ldquo;Unlike the revolutions of the 1970&rsquo;s that espoused a powerful socialist, anti-imperialist, anticapitalist, and social justice implulse, Arab revolutionaries were preoccupied more with the borad issues oif human rights, political accountability, and legal reform&rdquo; - pg 11
<ul>
<li>How much of this is due to peripherialization? As the power of individual states fade on the global stage, does that mean our goals are similariy less defined?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>&ldquo;Occupy&rdquo;
<ul>
<li>Draws links to the <a href="/posts/occupy_movement/">occupy movement</a>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Almost all expressed dissent against the effects of neoliberal policies, notably staggering inequality, unemployment, precarious work, and uncertain life that had gripped  a large segment of ordinary citizens&rdquo; - pg 13</li>
<li>&ldquo;Sociologists Manuel Castells and Sideny Tarrow suggest that the achievement of the Occupy movements was their very operation. Consdering the process as the product&rdquo; - pg 13</li>
<li>&ldquo;Philosphers Alain Badiuo and Slavoj Zizek imagined in these revolutionary arenas the propsect of a new social order&hellip;&rdquo;
<ul>
<li>Matt Ford points out - &ldquo;one cannot live in a cradle forever&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Questionable linkage, given that they were temporally and capitally the same
<ul>
<li>One can ask, why did the same type of revolutions not play out as a result of the <a href="/posts/1997_asian_financial_crisis/">1997 asian financial crisis</a></li>
<li>mid-way between 1970 and 2010</li>
<li>Why did the asian financial crisis coalese into protests? Massive looting, but less structural reform? Was that because many of the governements knew what to do?</li>
<li>&ldquo;The protests of 2011, however, were neither for revolution nor for reform; rather, they expressed a rebellion against the insitutions of representative democracy without offering any alternative&rdquo; - pg 17
<ul>
<li>What baggage does this claim bring?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Alternative political parties, Syriza in Greece, Pdemos in Spaim, Aam Aadmi Party in India gained support</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>&ldquo;Refolutions&rdquo;
<ul>
<li>Complex mix of revolutions in the 20th century fashion and reform</li>
<li>If we take the fact that these revolutions happened at all as the achievement, why did they not happen in 1997
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;The arab revolutions occured at an ideaological time in post-cold war history, when the very idea of revolution had largely disappeared from social thought and political struggles, where the three major postcolonial ideaologies - anticolonial nationalism, maxism-leninism, and militant islam - that vigorously advocated revolution had vanished or had been undermined. In their place was the powerful neoliberal paradigm and its normative frame&rdquo; - pg 18</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>&ldquo;Foucault&rsquo;s idea of entrapment in disciplinary power, as Edward Said contended, ended up replacing &ldquo;insurrenctionary scholarship&rdquo; with &ldquo;quietism&rdquo;</li>
<li>Movemnts became more fluid, states become more intelligent</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>&ldquo;Neoliberal Effect&rdquo;
<ul>
<li>1974 military coup against Chile</li>
<li>Argues that the diminishing of hte social contract with the IMF and World Bank, alongside structural adjustment policies and liberalization had initiaited this</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Novel revolutions?
<ul>
<li>Why did the 2011 revolutions turn out to be different?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li></li>
