<h3 id="chapters-1-2">Chapters 1-2</h3>
<ul>
<li>Propietary approaches vs theocentric ones</li>
<li>martial rape undiscussed</li>
<li>sets up the dichomety that the pre-Islam near east the proprieary approach was dominiant</li>
<li>female sexuality was propritary, women&rsquo;s subjectivity did not matter, belonged to husband or father</li>
<li>theocentric - affront to rights, rights are given by god, rape is an affront to god
<ul>
<li>propritary approach is absorbed into the theocentric one</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>was it two separate things that became one thing later?</li>
<li>violence inflicted on the body - does this have a ritual cadence?
<ul>
<li>paying a fine vs punishment of the bodies</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>is the idea of a propritary vs theological crafted in islamic law and extrapolated backwards into time problematic?</li>
<li>what spaces are the jurists interacting with when dealing with issues of violence against women?</li>
<li>is treating the all the laws with a theortical frame good for the study?
<ul>
<li>the authorizing discourse used as justification is &ldquo;this is islamic law&rdquo;, and she is trying to address that on a normative level</li>
<li>&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-4">3-4</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Maliki approach - dual penalty approach</p>
<ul>
<li>hadd punishment and the property punishment</li>
<li>freedom owns property, free woman owns her own body</li>
<li>minimum and equitable dower</li>
<li>sexuality for women is similar between free or enslaved</li>
<li>the commodity of sexuality can be misappropriated
<ul>
<li>thus a free woman is the owner of her sexuality, so payment should go to her</li>
<li>coercieve zina and property crime (transgression against crime and transgression against property crime)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>baber johnansen
<ul>
<li>private ownership of property is central to islamic law</li>
<li>does private property underpin rape laws?
<ul>
<li>kiesha ali</li>
<li><a href="/posts/zakat/">zakat</a> and personal wealth?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>manaf3 - capacity, usufroctory benefit
<ul>
<li>anything can have manaf3</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>zina is diametrically opposed to marital sex</li>
<li>divine claims are more important than personal claims
<ul>
<li>however, if the woman did not consent to zina, and the satisfaction of the god and satisfaction of the person are not mututally exclusive</li>
<li>the intertwining of the divine claims and personal ones</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hanafi approach - single penalty</p>
<ul>
<li>hanafis believe the manaf3 of people are not mal, they are only rendered manaf3 under a contract</li>
<li>generally propriatary view of sexuality</li>
<li>marriage requires an exchange value, difference is that the hanafi school does not have the &ldquo;proprietary notion of subjectivity&rdquo;</li>
<li>linguistic point - never use istihab</li>
<li>hadd only punishment for coercive zina</li>
<li>&ldquo;similar to double jepoardy&rdquo; - can&rsquo;t have two punishments for one crime, you have to identify which crime you want to prosecture
<ul>
<li>hadd (crime against god) and mahr (possibly licit sex)
<ul>
<li>means that you have to understand the mahr whether it&rsquo;s licit or illicit, the volition of the human subject has no meaning</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>raises the questions of the dower in coercive zina</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>zina can&rsquo;t be the basis of trade for dower, because then it&rsquo;s similar to paying for dower</li>
<li>coercive zina provokes divine and interpersonal claims</li>
<li>extremely little interest in the violition of the women</li>
<li>central argument - hadd and sadaq (dower) are incompatible
<ul>
<li>dower vs dowery</li>
<li>dower - payment that is given by the husband to the wife</li>
<li>could you pay sadaq retroactively?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>underage boy and older woman</p>
<ul>
<li>underage boy is different because he has not developed sexually (very minority position)</li>
<li>understanding of consent is fundalmentally different for a woman than a man</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>do hanafi judges primarily ask themselves the question on the licitness of the sexual act, whereas maliki school asks whether the source of the payment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ta&rsquo;zir - is there punishment for the violence to her</p>
<ul>
<li>if the payment is the same as the payment for marriage, is there a fine?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-6">5-6</h3>
<ul>
<li>athar and jurisprudence</li>
<li>hanafis tried to avoid hadd at all costs, while the malikis didn&rsquo;t
<ul>
<li>however, a distcintion must be made between the plaintiff and the witnesses
<ul>
<li>four adult men and witnesses (quranic), and no compulsion within the hanafi school to witness</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>no way to pursue rape charges without zina</li>
<li>largely a crime against god alone</li>
<li>were all cases of aversion to hadd, was there differentiation?</li>
<li>social values cannot be read off of these legal categories</li>
<li>why is punishment greater for a woman who&rsquo;s been married</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>sunni law - if a woman&rsquo;s ever had licit sex, then any sex afterwards is illicit</li>
<li>why are slave punishments set at half? their legal status?
<ul>
<li>they have diminished agency</li>
<li>formally, there is a hadith</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h2 id="concept-of-shibha---how-did-this-evolve-over-time">concept of shibha - how did this evolve over time?</h2>
</li>
<li>maliki&rsquo;s accept pregenacy as circumstantal evidence
<ul>
<li>allows victims to enter into court against the assailant</li>
<li>what could prove compensation</li>
<li>3luq - at least two eyewitnesses</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>divergence between maliki jurists and hanafi ones, was the pursuit of propriatary principals about upholding consistency elsewhere?
<ul>
<li>maliki&rsquo;s are also women friendly in divorce</li>
<li>maliki&rsquo;s are where modern legistators took their divorce rulings</li>
<li>maliki&rsquo;s tend to care much more about the women</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>hanafi school is the playing out of Kufan traditions against women</li>
<li>&ldquo;step inside the discourses and try to view them from within&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
