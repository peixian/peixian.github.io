<ul>
<li>strings in python are immutable
<ul>
<li>concatenating a single character n times to a string in a for loop has O(n^2) complexity</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>strings often have brute-force solutions that use O(n) but can be reduced to O(1)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="linked-lists">Linked Lists</h2>
<ul>
<li>often conceptually simple, and more about cleanly coding what&rsquo;s specified</li>
<li>consider using a dummy head to avoid checking for empty lists</li>
<li>easy to forget update next/previous for head and tail</li>
<li>algorithms that operate on singly linked lists often benefit from using two iterators
<ul>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="stacks-and-queues">Stacks and Queues</h2>
<ul>
<li>Stacks
<ul>
<li>push/pop on a LL implemented stack has O(1) ops</li>
<li>push/pop on an array implemented stack has O(1) ops, but maximum size, unless there is dynamic resizing, where the amortized is O(1)</li>
<li>last-in/first-out semantics makes it good for making reverse iterators
<ul>
<li>parsing typically benefits from a stack</li>
<li>consider augmenting the basic stack or queue data structure to support additional ops</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Queue

<ul>
<li>which has <code>popleft</code> and <code>popright</code> functions</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>queues are ideal when order needs to be preserved</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="binary-trees">Binary Trees</h2>
<ul>
<li>full binary tree is when every node other than the leaves have two children</li>
<li>perfect binary tree is a full binary tree where all the leaves are at the same depth, and every parent has two children
<ul>
<li>2^(h+1)-1 nodes -&gt; 2^(h+1) are leaves</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>complete binary tree is a binary tree where every level is filled and all leaves are to the left as possible
<ul>
<li>n nodes has height floor(log(n))</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>recursive algorithms are well suited to problems on binary trees</li>
<li>you might be able to reuse existing tree nodes to reduce space complexity to o(1)</li>
<li>consider left and right skewed trees when doing complexity analysis, O(h) complexity, where h is the tree height, translates into O(log n) complexity for balanced trees, and O(n) complexity for skewed trees</li>
<li>&ldquo;parent&rdquo; field makes code simpler</li>
<li>easy to make the mistake of treating a node that has a single child as a leaf</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="heaps">Heaps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Specialized binary tree</li>
<li>complete binary tree that satisfies the heap property - the key at each node is as great as the keys stored in its children</li>
<li>max-heap supports O(log n) insertions, O(1) time lookup, and O(log n) deletion of the max element. The extract max op is defined to delete and return max element</li>
<li>sometimes referred to as a priority queue, each element has a &ldquo;priority&rdquo;, and deletion removes the element with the highest priority</li>
<li>min-heap is a completely symmetric version of the data structure and supports an O(1) looked up for the minimum element</li>
<li>you can use a heap to keep track the k lognest string in a streaming string system, each insert is log n time, and if you have a min-heap, you can choose when to drop</li>
<li>use a heap when you care about the largest or smallest elements, and do not have to support fast lookup, delete, or search operations</li>
<li>a heap is a good choice when you need to compute K largest or K smallest elements, former should use a min-heap, latter should use a max heap</li>
<li>python has the <code>heapq</code> module to implement a heap, but it specifically only has a min-heap. Insert the negative for integers or floats, or for objects, implement <code>__lt()__</code> appropriately</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="searching">Searching</h2>
<ul>
<li>Search algorithms can be classifed in a number of ways. Is the underlying collection static or dynamic, and are inserts/deletes interleaved with searching?
<ul>
<li>can you preprocess the data?</li>
<li>are there special statistical properties of the data that can be exploited?</li>
<li>should we operate directly on the data or transform it?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="binary-search">binary search</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>O(log n) search time, but requires a sort that takes at least O(n log n) time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>how do you implement a binary search?</p>

<li>
<p>binary search is applicable than just sorted arrays, you can use it to search an interval of real numbers or integers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if we use sorting, and the computation performed after sorting is faster than sorting, look for solutions that do not perform a complete sort</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="general-searching">general searching</h3>
<ul>
<li>objects have comparable <code>__lt()__</code> and <code>__gt()__</code> for user defined types</li>
<li>langauge already knows how to compare built-in types</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="hash-tables">Hash tables</h2>
<ul>
<li>Updating keys in hash tables -&gt; don&rsquo;t do it
<ul>
<li>delete the key, then update it, then move it back</li>
<li>keys should generally be not mutable</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>we want to aim for rolling hash functions
<ul>
<li>hash functions should examine all the characters in a string, and not let one character dominate</li>
<li>we also want to implement a rolling hash function, where if one character is removed from the start and added to the end, it should not effect the final result</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hash tables is a good data structure to represent a dictionary
<ul>
<li>sometimes a trie gets used to store a dynamic set of strings, and has computational advantages when many letters are repeated</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>anagram example: to find anagrams, you can preprocess each trail and sort, and append a list on the other side</li>
<li>designing a hash table class
<ul>
<li>you can implement <code>__hash__</code>, and <code>hash</code> is a builtin</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>hash tables have the best theoretical and real world performance for lookup, insert, and delete.</li>
<li>consider using a hash table as a signature to enhance performance</li>
<li>consider using a precomputed <code>lookup table</code></li>
<li>when defining the own type that will be put in the hash table, make sure to know the relationship between logical equality and the fields the hash function inspects
<ul>
<li>anytime equality is implemented, imperative that the hash function is also implemented</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>sometimes a <code>multimap</code> can be used, which contains multiple values for single key</li>
<li>hash table types <code>set, dict, collections.defaultdict, collections.Counter</code>
<ul>
<li><code>set.remove</code> raises an error if the value is not in the list</li>
<li><code>set.discard</code> does not alert if the value is not in the list</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>note that not every type is hashable, mutable containers are notably not hashable</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="sorting">Sorting</h2>
<ul>
<li>sorting is a common problem</li>
<li>naive sorting algorithms run in O(n^2) time, some run in O(nlog) time</li>
<li>sorting table:
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>sorting</th>
<th>in place (O(1) space)?</th>
<th>stable (duplicate items remain in the same order)?</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>heapsort</td>
<td>yes</td>
<td>no</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>merge sort</td>
<td>no</td>
<td>yes</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>quicksort</td>
<td>yes</td>
<td>yes</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</li>
<li>well implemented quicksort is usually the best choice
<ul>
<li>for shorter arrays (&lt;10), insertion sort is easier to code and faster</li>
<li>if every element is known to be at most <em>k</em> places away from its final location, a min-heap can be used to get O(n log k) algorithm</li>
<li>if there are a small amount of distinct keys, counting sort works well
<ul>
<li>if there are many duplicate keys, we add the keys to a BST, with linked list for elements which have the same key; the sorted result can be derived from an in-order traversal of the BST</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>most sorting algorithms are not stable, mergesort, carefully implemented, can be made stable.</li>
<li>most sorting routines are based on a compare function. It&rsquo;s also possible to use numerical attributes directly with radix sort</li>
<li><code>sorted()</code> returns a copy using <code>__lt__</code></li>
<li><code>list.sort</code> sorts in place</li>
<li>time complexity of any reasonable library is O(n log n), most sorting functionalities are based on quicksort, which has O(1) space</li>
<li>sorting problems usually come in two flavors:
<ul>
<li>using sorting to make the subsequent steps in an algorithm simpler
<ul>
<li>use a library sort function, possibly with custom comparator</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>desinging a custom subroutine
<ul>
<li>use a data structure like a BST, heap, or array indexed by values</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>certain problems become easier to understand, as well as solve, when the input is sorted
<ul>
<li>best when inputs have natural order, or preprocessing step to speed up searching</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>for specialized input (very small range of values or small number of values), it&rsquo;s possible to sort in O(n) time</li>
<li>sorting can be implemented with less space than required by a brute force approach</li>
<li>sometimes it is not obvious what to sort on</li>
<li><code>sort</code> -&gt; inplace for list
<ul>
<li>implements stable in place sort for list objects, returning None.</li>
<li>takes two arguments, both optional:
<ul>
<li>key - assumed to be a function which takes list elements and maps to objects which are comparable</li>
<li>reverse - whether to sort in descending order, by default <code>sort</code> does it in ascending order</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>to sort an iterable, use <code>sorted()</code>
<ul>
<li>also take identical key and reverse objects</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="binary-search-trees">Binary Search Trees</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>BSTs are workhorse data structures and can be used to solve almost every data structures problem reasonably efficiently, and offer the ability to efficiently search for a key as well as find min and max elements</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Just a binary tree where the ndoes store keys that are comparable such as integers or strings</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Key lookup, insertion, and deletion take time proportional to the height of the tree, which can be worst-case O(n)</p>
<ul>
<li>some implementations of insert and delete which guarentee that the tree heigh is O(log n)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Common mistake with BSTs -&gt; object that&rsquo;s present in the BST is not updated</p>
<ul>
<li>avoid putting mutable objects in the BST! If you must mutate, remove, update, then add it back</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>BSTs give you the ability to find min and max elements, and find the next largest/next smallest element</p>
<ul>
<li>implement some kind of ordering alongside this, finding the min, the max, next largest/smallest, and lookup, delete, and find take O(log n) time</li>
<li>both BSTs and hash tables use O(n) space</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>BST implementation</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="color:#66d9ef">class</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">BSTNode</span>:

<span style="color:#66d9ef">def</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">search_bst</span>(tree, key):
    <span style="color:#66d9ef">return</span> (tree

</code></pre></div></li>
</ul>
<p>-Since the program that descends the tree with each step, and spends O(1) time per level, time complexity is O(h), where h is the height of the tree</p>
<ul>
<li>We can iterate through the elements in sorted order in time O(n) regardless of balance</li>
<li>Some problems need a combination of a BST and a hashtable. If you need to order something, you can use the dict to contain additional, mutable information, and the dict can contain direct elements in the tree</li>
<li>Sometimes you need to augment a BST to make it possible to manipulate more complicated data such as intervals and give more complex queries, such as the number of elements in a range</li>
<li>BST property is a global property - a binary search tree may have the property that each node&rsquo;s key is greater than the key at its left child and smaller than the key at its right child, but it may not be a BST</li>
<li>NO BST LIBRARY IN PYTHON
<ul>
<li><code>sortedcontainers</code> or <code>bintrees</code> can be used</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="recursion">Recursion</h2>
<ul>
<li>Recursion is an approach where the solution depends partially on solutions to smaller instances of related problems</li>
<li>Often appropriate when the input is expressed using recursive rules, such as computer grammar</li>
<li>Searching, enumeration, divide and conquer, decomposing a complex problem into a set of similar smaller instance are all scenarios where recursion may be suitable</li>
<li>A recursive function consists of base cases and calls to the same function with different arguments</li>
<li>Two main ingredients for successful recursion:
<ul>
<li>identifying the base cases</li>
<li>ensuring progress</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A divide and conquer algorithm works by repeatedly decomposing a problem into two or more smaller independent subproblems of the same kind, until it gets to instances that are simple enough to be solved directly
<ul>
<li>solutions to the subproblems are then combined to give a solution to the original problem</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>divide and conquer is not synonmyous with recursion
<ul>
<li>the problem is divided into two or more independent smaller problems that are of the same type as the original problem, recursion is more general, there may be a single subproblem, but the subproblems may not be independent (dynamic programming), and they may not be as the same type as the original (regex matching).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In addition, sometimes to improve runtime and reduce space complexity, you can implement divide and conquer using iteration</li>
<li>use recursion as an alterative to deeply nested iteration loops</li>
<li>removing recursion can be done by mimicking call stack with the stack data structure</li>
<li>recursion can be easily removed from tail recursive programs by using the while loop, no stack is needed</li>
<li>if recursive functions may end up being called with the same arguments more than once, cache the results (aka dp)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="dp">DP</h2>
<ul>
<li>General technique for solving optimization, search, and counting problems that can be decomposed</li>
<li>consider using DP when you have to make choices to arrive at the solution, especially when it involves subproblems</li>
<li>key difference between divide-and-conquer and dp is that DP shows the same subproblem may reoccur</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="greedy-algorithms-and-invariants">Greedy Algorithms and Invariants</h2>
<ul>
<li>greedy algorithms computes a solution in steps, at each step the algorithm makes a decision that is locally optimum, and it never changes the decision</li>
<li>does not necessarily produce the optimal solution. Consider making change for 48 pence in old British currency where the coins came in at 30, 24, 12, 6, 3, and 1</li>
