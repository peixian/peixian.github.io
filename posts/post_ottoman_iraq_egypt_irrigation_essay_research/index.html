<li>Argument:
<ul>
<li>The construction of the Aswan Low/High Dams, alongside the Hindiya and Kut barrages, was a time of technomodernity that ultimately failed to respect the locals.

<p>Dumb question: why does the historiography matter?</p>

<li>Reading essay on why the orientalist perceptions, but having a difficult time squaring why that it matters</li>

<p>I have all these resources</p>

<li>
<p>How do we square notions of modernity (as in what we consider to be modern either by orientialist perspectives or not)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Two main points:</p>
<ul>
<li>obsession with history (philae, babylon, etc)</li>
<li>lack of care about disease and salination (because it mostly affects the people and not infectious)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Disease and salination are both extremely common throughout all these projects, why was it not brought up?</p>
<ul>
<li>Beacuse these affect the people and not the workers nor their ideals</li>
<li>Why should I care?</li>
