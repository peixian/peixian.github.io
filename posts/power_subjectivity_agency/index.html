<ul>
<li>Transtemporal meaning of man, argues man&rsquo;s natural state is towards &ldquo;enlightement&rdquo; as civilization</li>
<li>Paradoxically, this requires a structure to exist to preserve it (enlightened despot)</li>
<li>Distinguishes between <em>private</em> and <em>public</em> freedoms
<ul>
<li>Private freedom is when you hold certain privilages, such as pastor or soldier, where your choices are constrained. In cases of rulers, their choices are even more constrained, but constrained in choosing <em>not to do something</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>importance of &ldquo;presentism&rdquo;, Kant believes that we are on the verge of something radical, and that there is potential in the presentism</li>

<ul>
<li>Dialects between the master and slave</li>
<li>Master requires the slave to recongize him as the master, whereas the slave later derives self worth from their labor, which then leads to a more developed conciousness of self for the slave</li>
<li>The master/slave distinction is caused because two recongize that each other is required to distinguish the self, and from that, the one who chooses to value life over death becomes weaker, and therefore the slave</li>
<li>Fanon notes that this dialectic is not complete for the colonial, the colonized often end up mimicking the colonizers, which does not lead to a more developed conciousness of the self
<ul>
<li>not to mention the colonizer becomes brutalized in the process, which suggests that there is more development that the simple dialectic gives</li>

<ul>
<li>A mixture of both Kant and Hegel, Du Bois suggests that post-emancipation black lives are at the precipice of something new (he calls this Canaan, similar to Kant&rsquo;s presentism), but also suggests that the act of self reconigition between blacks and whites about their differences causes a dual conciousness to appear within the black community</li>

<ul>
<li>discusses the base and superstructure formulation, and says that superstructure is the &ldquo;ideaology of the class&rdquo;, and the &ldquo;form of conciousness&rdquo; (pg 76)
<ul>
<li>so superstructures arise from
<ul>
<li>legal and political wrt to production (institutions)</li>
<li>forms of conciousness which is a specific view of the world (forms of conciousness)</li>
<li>and a process where men become concious of the economic conlfict (political and cultural)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>aruges that these concepts almost magically appear into being (pg 77 bottom), and possibly their definitions do not capture everything</li>
<li>marx&rsquo;s attempt here was to link thought and activity, which before him, had been separated, but marx hasn&rsquo;t built anything radically new, rather he largely redefined thought into superstructure and activity into base, and then proceeded to link them together
<ul>
<li>marx&rsquo;s unconvincing argument that art does not correlate to the peak of any culture</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>argues that what people are fundalmentally lacking is the recgonition that connections between material production and institutions and conciousness
<ul>
<li>proposes Plekhanov&rsquo;s distinction of five sequential elements instead (state of productive forces, economic conditinos, socio-political regimes, psyche of social man, and other ideaologies)</li>
<li>basically says that when the analysis begins from superstructure and base, they fail to recongize that these two entities are arrived at, not started from
<ul>
<li>superstructures tend to reach out to big things and encompass a variety of ideas that tends to make the differences between the two entities believable</li>
<li>reudction of base to a category is something marx warned against</li>

<h3 id="draft-about-williams">Draft about Williams</h3>
<p>Williams spends significant time discussing the Marxist understanding of base and superstructure as a leaky abstraction. He first describes the concept of a base (or by his art as reflection analogy, as &ldquo;reality&rdquo;) which represents the Marxist concept of the physical production processes, and superstructure (&ldquo;art&rdquo; or &ldquo;reflection of reality&rdquo;) as everything else non-tangible that arises from the base. This is fleshed out through an understanding of reflection/mediation, homology, and tradition/institutions. The binary of base/superstructure as two separate entities is incomplete, he says, because the entity of superstructure has largely grown to encompass so much that it has lost meaning. For example, he gives the pianist/piano maker analogy, because the piano maker can be classified as &ldquo;base&rdquo; through their labor, but the pianist as &ldquo;superstructure&rdquo; because they are acting upon the base, a distinction between the status of their labor can be somehow made, which is absurd. In addition, Williams points out how the base/superstructure duality presumes that these entities are static and unchanging, while they shape each other, processes can somehow be bucketed into one or the other easily. It also ignores the temporal aspect, just as Marx argues against the overly reductionist understanding of &ldquo;theory&rdquo; and &ldquo;activity&rdquo;, examining conditions via the duality of base/superstructure presumes their existence as forces of nature, forgetting that forces can eventually shape mold themselves into this stable state. Many contemporary studies of Iraq, for example, presume the sectarian identities that exist today (Sunni/Shia/Kurd) have always existed, and begin their historical analysis from this perspective. Yet this is completely false, research of historical conditions within Iraq would tell you that these identities were not always as pronounced, and far more fluid than we would give them. Tribes who lived alongside borders would often change their identity depending on the local hegemon of the time and would find the current hardened identities to be absurd.</p>
<p>Williams also has the concept of &ldquo;determination&rdquo;, which seems to be a combination of the concepts about deterministic processes and reductionism. He describes determination as being aware of limits and setting of pressures, this seems to align with the idea that processes that always give you the same output given the same input are considered to be <em>deterministic</em>. Combined with his discussion about &ldquo;overdetermination&rdquo;, Williams seems to suggest that the base/superstructure abstraction is too leaky, things cannot be easily categorized as base or superstructure, and inputs into the base or superstructure do not guarantee the same results every time.</p>
<p>What does this tell us about agency as a concept? The 18th Brumaire (&ldquo;men do not make their history willingly etc etc&rdquo;) suggests that people operate similar to Galton boards (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo9Esp1yaC8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo9Esp1yaC8</a>). The Galton board demonstrates the normal distribution, one of the fundamental theorems of probability: random trials, repeated over and over, each with the same chance, eventually end up at the bell curve. To stretch this analogy, this is the overdetermination that Williams says, while we know that eventually, processes arrive at a stable state, each trial is messy and one can only operate on marginal probabilities.</p>
