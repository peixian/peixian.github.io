<ul>
<li>main character, taraf abassiyya
<ul>
<li>list out the main old mowkebs here</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The repetition and performance allows for a particular voyeuristic view</li>
<li>How is it voyeuristic? How does this create a different future?
<ul>
<li>self flattering notions, such as the guy faked who sings about putting dirt in their eyes</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Notions of competition, and status making</li>
<li>Because it is so public, it serves as a platform for statements of piety or politics</li>
<li>Because it is an oral tradition, it must be constantly reproduced
<ul>
<li>Under saddam years, it&rsquo;s noted that these rituals survived through houses</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Because one has to be recognized as a pilgrim and a servant through this public nature
<ul>
<li>through this mutual recognition, we can see&hellip;something</li>
<li>they access a particular time through this harmonization</li>
<li>it&rsquo;s not just about being a good pilgrim, but about being <strong>seen</strong> as a good pilgrim</li>

<ul>
<li>Azerbaijani flag, Iraqi flags</li>
</ul>

</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="outline-forming-the-present-through-husseiniyya-rituals">Outline - Forming the Present Through Husseiniyya Rituals</h2>
<ul>
<li>Each center chapter follows a single character and tries to focus the lens around them, zooming out to describe the concept</li>
<li>Goal is to move towards a theory of a constructed present</li>
<li>Starts with the center of the ritual (radood and audience), goes to describing the institutions, then goes to describe how a &ldquo;normal&rdquo; person participates</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<ul>
<li>Thesis: rituals as a sight of constructing the present</li>
<li>Lead in: evoking the Imam as a nearhuman construction (<a href="/posts/johnson_automatic_religion/">Johnson - Automatic Religion</a>)
<ul>
<li>Various rituals of approaching the shrine</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>One understudied area is the role of the radood</li>
<li>Main key is that the majlis with radood is a specific form ritual that binds individual and society, future and past</li>
<li>Main questions to answer:
<ul>
<li>How do ritual participants view themselves? Do they see rituals as subsuming the self?</li>
<li>What about the &ldquo;violent&rdquo; nature of specific rituals?</li>
<li>How are these rituals sustained?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Look to al-Wardi lamahat vol 2</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="chapter-1-majilis-husseini-al-3aza-experience">Chapter 1 - Majilis Husseini/al-3aza Experience</h3>
<ul>
<li>Mainly enthographic chapter</li>
<li>Main character might be Mutathir the radood</li>
<li>Main questions to answer:
<ul>
<li>What is it like to be in a ritual? Radood audience interaction to draw in the audience</li>
<li>Where do the rituals happen? What contexts are they performed in?
<ul>
<li>What are the casual forms of difference (between Pakistani, Iraqi, Indian, etc)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What is invoked and evoked with the ritual? Is it saddness for Hussein (as some ritual participants have said), or is it something more?</li>
<li>Banal nature of the rituals, and how it is not necessarily different than music festivals
<ul>
<li>The banality of these rituals actually make it much more interesting, because it reveals how easily new views of the world are fashioned even without a clear sacred/profane distinction</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Look to Geertz here, what symbols are floating around? For Sahlins, what kind of kinship is being produced in this moment? How are the symbols alive here (al-Shur?)
<ul>
<li>Also potentially useful to look at Tanya Luhrmann&rsquo;s work on Evanglicial Christian prayers and esoteric mental states of trance</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="chapter-2-institutions-of-the-radoods-and-mowkebs">Chapter 2 - Institutions of the Radoods and Mowkebs</h3>
<ul>
<li>Investigative chapter around what religious institutions sustain the radoods</li>
<li>Main character: Ali the radood school teacher
<ul>
<li>How does Ali engage by creating the institution of radoods</li>
<li>Who comes to school? What are their backgrounds?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Questions to answer
<ul>
<li>What seemingly non-religious work needs to be done to sustain this structure?</li>
<li>How is authority created? Who creates these authorities, and are they done by the &ldquo;religious&rdquo; or &ldquo;secular&rdquo;? Is that even an useful distinction to draw here?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="chapter-3-majilis-as-a-pilgrimage">Chapter 3 - Majilis as a pilgrimage</h3>
<ul>
<li>Main character: Fathal the security guard
<ul>
<li>Karbalaei native, but not particularly religious</li>
<li>Goal is to show how &ldquo;regular&rdquo; people engage with religion</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Look to Asad here, what types of self is attempting to be molded by going to this pilgrimage?</li>
<li>How do pilgrims signal to each other about the status of their pilgrimage? How does the shrine institutions support this?</li>
<li>This chapter might be cut or revised, it&rsquo;s a little vague right now</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<ul>
<li>Husseiniyya rituals draw in the audience and participants through N ways</li>
<li>This allows the audience to view themselves in a different way, constructing a different present</li>
<li>One underaddressed aspect within this study is the register of tragedy, which is potential for future work</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="old">Old</h2>
<h3 id="peacebuilding">Peacebuilding</h3>
<ul>
<li>Reintegration of Iraqi Militias
<ul>

<ul>
<li>PMF command structures are vastly different, from KH&rsquo;s Hezbollah-like situation to brigade 30
<ul>
<li>Money laundering and ghost soldiers</li>
<li>Who is lining their pockets and benefiting from different command structures?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sectarian conflicts
<ul>
<li>PMF cross cuts class, race, and religion
<ul>
<li>Shia Turkmen, Christians, pro-sistani vs pro-iran</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Ivory Coast
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Warrior generation&rdquo;, political violence similar levels, are there models to be drawn here?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Post-conflict peacebuilding within formal state structures
<ul>
<li>The Iraqi state did not totally collapse and fought off an insurgency, is this different than integrating militias in newly formed states?</li>
<li>External actors
<ul>
<li>UNAMI</li>
<li>US</li>
<li>Iran</li>
<li>etc</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mechanics of peacebuilding
<ul>
<li>Combants to civilains -&gt; Has this happened?</li>
<li>Post-conflict state -&gt; Has Iraqi society reached &ldquo;post-conflict&rdquo;? What determines post-conflict?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>&ldquo;Big&rdquo; questions
<ul>
<li>Current government framing of Iraq
<ul>
<li>Lack of legitmacy on several key institutions
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Supreme&rdquo; court has no constitutional legitmacy</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>KRG
<ul>
<li>Resolved issues of KRG disputes, how do the peshmerga fit into this equation?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What constitutes as &ldquo;rehabilitation&rdquo; and &ldquo;reintegration&rdquo;?
<ul>
<li>UN has often sought &ldquo;reintegration&rdquo; by waiting it out, which has rarely worked. Succesful examples are Nepal and Namibia, which sought greater reintegration via massive state-sponsered jobs programs
<ul>
<li>How does this change in a world of low interest rates? Namibia and Nepal had difficulties borrowing money, does the shift in the global markets affect this?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>&ldquo;Big&rdquo; reintegration - who are the funders of reintegration for previous states? Who funds reintegration for the Iraqi state?
<ul>
<li>Who directs reintegration? Often times funded and directed in DC, but acted upon in other states</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What do we reintegrate back into? Reintegration implies return to prewar &ldquo;normalcy&rdquo; &ndash; the same conditions that gestated the conflict.
<ul>
<li>Sierra Leone of 2005 looks like the Sierra Leone of 1991</li>
<li>What structural changes are available?
<ul>
<li>What does this look like in the backdrop of Arab Spring? Of the 2019/2020 protests?</li>
</ul>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>External communities
<ul>
<li>How do the communities reintegrating the militia members feel?</li>
<li>What about disapora?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Generational questions
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Reintegration&rdquo; implies that there is a life to go back to. Are militia members who spent their lives in conflict have this open as an opportunity?</li>
