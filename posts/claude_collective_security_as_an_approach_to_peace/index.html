<ul>
<li>Collective security is a halfway point between anarchy and world governement</li>
<li>talks about how collective security has become a bandied about term, but means something completely different</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The achievement of orthodox status is very often fatal to the integreity of a concept</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;collective security&rdquo; began as a specialized term, initially meant to hamstring aggressions
<ul>
<li>now has largely lost its meaning, appropriated for any &amp; all approaches to collective actions that build peace and order, synonym for world peace</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>collective security should be defined as &ldquo;a second line of defense against wars where settlement should but does not prevent a war&rdquo;</li>
<li>assumptions: wars are likely to occur and most can be prevented</li>
<li>about forestalling the arbitrary &amp; aggresive use of force</li>
<li>constract with pacific security
<ul>
<li>pacific security - moral ambiguity, uses tools like investigating, reconciliation, arbitration, etc</li>
<li>collective security - moral clarity, uses diplomatic, economic, and military sanctions</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="subjective-requirements-on-collective-security">subjective requirements on collective security</h2>
<ul>
<li>aggression in one part of the world is not localized, things can easily spread</li>
<li>people &amp; states must recongize their interests align with the international
<ul>
<li>demands that many national loyalities become harmonized
<ul>
<li>is this similar to how domestic institutions ahve aligned with <a href="/posts/barnett_et_al_international_organizations_and_the_diffusions_of_power/">Barnett et al: International Organizations and the Diffusions of Power</a>?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>fundalmentally requires the state to give up very much
<ul>
<li>control of military</li>
<li>follow rulebook adherence to international order</li>
<li>runs against the instincts of statement and politicians</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>collective security is meant to be used against any state, anonomous aggressors and anonomyous victims</li>
<li>states <strong>must</strong> be confidence in collective security, or else the whole thing falls apart</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="objective-requirements">objective requirements</h2>
<ul>
<li>power: requires several great powers of equal strength</li>
<li>membership: must be universal, assumes any state may become aggressor
<ul>
<li>proposes that the preponderance of power be available to any state</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>aims for the organization of police action, requires a world where every state is caught in and dependent on one other</li>
<li>requires large scale disarmament and lack of economic self sufficiency</li>
</ul>
