<p>Title: &ldquo;The Memory of Anfal: How is Anfal Remembered Today?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Anfal genocide killed an unspeakable amount Kurds and left lasting marks on society. Comprised of eight separate campaigns, the legacy of Anfal goes beyond Kurdistan and requires us to situtate it within a larger context of genocide. I will speak about my research on the memory of Anfal, involving a survey of existing literature on post-traumatic stress on children as well as contemporary research on how Anfal is taught and remembered in schools within Kurdistan today.</p>
