<li>Shiites agree that the 1920&rsquo;s they left themseolves out of the cold with regards to the British, now they sought US patronage (in the forms of the <a href="/posts/supreme_council_for_the_islamic_revolution_in_iraq_sciri/">Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq (SCIRI)</a> and <a href="/posts/dawa/">Dawa</a>)</li>

<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<ul>
<li>Timeline
<ul>
<li>Late 1950&rsquo;s - start of shia militancy</li>
<li>Mid 1960&rsquo;s -&gt; <a href="/posts/arif_brothers/">&lsquo;Arif brothers</a> caused Islamic activism to thrive</li>
<li>1974 -&gt; mass protests and <a href="/posts/baath/">Baath</a>ist executions of shia leaders</li>
<li>1977 -&gt; Arbaeen demonstrations shook the political elite</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Argues that there are 3 main theories of shiism in Iraq
<ul>
<li>Communal
<ul>
<li>shia majority vs sunni minority</li>
<li>issue treats shiism as one monolithic thing</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cultural-essentialist
<ul>
<li>largely arose after 1979</li>
<li>orientalist in outlook</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Conjunctural
<ul>
<li>two patterns to shia military social movements
<ul>
<li>islamist protest is born of common greviences due to modernity, there is nothing inherent about Islam, these are cross-cultural issues given an Islamic flavor</li>
<li>local: shiite activism is spurred by protest against group discrimination under authoritarian regimes - <a href="/posts/blaydes_state_of_repression/">Blaydes - State of Repression</a>?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>forms of religiosity differ from one groupo to another</li>
<li>distinguishes between tribal leaders and ulema
<ul>
<li>islam bridges/substites the unity between these two groups</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>3 major classes
<ul>
<li>clerical class</li>
<li>mercantile class in <a href="/posts/najaf/">najaf</a></li>
<li>modern middle class</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>shias had published regularly after 1979, previously their publications were largely totally obscure</li>
<li>migration after <a href="/posts/iran_iraq_war/">iran/iraq war</a> to western countries only further encouraged publication</li>
<li>iraqi security services archives also contain information</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="islamism-fundalmentalism-communalism-and-the-nation-state">Islamism, Fundalmentalism, Communalism, and the Nation-State</h2>
<ul>
<li>Rise of shia islam is conflated with two things
<ul>
<li>1970&rsquo;s had a broad rise of Sunni/Shia &ldquo;fundalmentalism&rdquo;</li>
<li>a rise in secular militancy</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We need to make a clear delination between shiite activism and islamic militancy</li>
<li>Islamic activism dates ot the late 19th century, relating to the major, but not only reformation of Islam
<ul>
<li><a href="/posts/usuli/">Usuli</a> vs <a href="/posts/archbari/">Archbari</a></li>
<li><a href="/posts/babi/">Babi</a> vs orthodox</li>
<li><a href="/posts/sufism/">sufism</a> vs the french</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>major religious reformations seek to purify islam, either by:
<ul>
<li>stating the tradition is enternal &amp; true</li>
<li>constructing a paradigm of pure, prisetine Islam</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>An all embracing Islam has been held by <a href="/posts/jamal_al_din_afghani/">Jamal al-Din Afghani</a>, <a href="/posts/muhammad_abduh/">Muhammad Abduh</a>, <a href="/posts/wahhabi/">Wahhabi</a>, <a href="/posts/hassan_al_banna/">hassan al-banna</a>, <a href="/posts/ruhollah_khomeini/">ruhollah khomeini</a>

</ul>
<h3 id="shi-ite-social-structures">Shi&rsquo;ite social structures</h3>
<ul>
<li>Shi&rsquo;a in 1921 did not constitute a closely knit body of people, they were originally quite divided</li>
<li>Tribal confederation emerged during the Mamluik era</li>
<li>Shia imams were presented as gallant knights and brave warriors, and then guarenteed commerial and property contracts</li>
<li>Clerical class in shrine cities and the free traveling sayyids emrged as a &ldquo;bedouin&rdquo; or &ldquo;arabic&rdquo; in opposite with the &ldquo;sufist&rdquo; or &ldquo;persanized&rdquo; sh&rsquo;ism of iran</li>
<li><a href="/posts/najaf/">najaf</a> was governed by armed guilds knowns as the shuri or zuguri, who controlled the city and provided defense against external hazards
<ul>
<li>created a separate exchange-liasons with the clerical class and the artisans, merchants, and pilgrims</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="/posts/najaf/">najaf</a> and <a href="/posts/karbala/">karbala</a> specifically rebelled against the ottomans in 1915 and 1916 respectively</li>
<li>post-1921 - nomadic tribes lost their significance</li>

<li>shifts from the shi&rsquo;is as rural poor fallahin into poor and middle class city dewllers</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>sectarian policies of the <a href="/posts/arif_brothers/">&lsquo;Arif brothers</a> and the <a href="/posts/baath/">Baath</a> accelerated the development of a coherent shia identity</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="areas-of-conflict-shi-is-and-the-modern-state">Areas of Conflict: Shi&rsquo;is and the modern state</h3>
<ul>
<li>political conflict premised on under-representation
<ul>
<li>first two decades of the monarchy and waned in the last decade, but then resurfaced under &lsquo;arif and the ba&rsquo;th</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>economic grievances based off of landed shi&rsquo;ite groups that opposed land reforms in 1959</li>
<li>cultural encroachment, arab nationalism replaced islam, such as <a href="/posts/sati_al_husri/">sati al-husri</a>&rsquo;s cultural nationalism based on language and history
<ul>
<li>reduced islam to a predicate to ethnicity, which destroys the centrality of religion</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>nusuli affair in the late 1920&rsquo;s
<ul>
<li>nusuli, syrian secondary school teacher glorified the <a href="/posts/ummayad/">ummayad</a> dynasty, which the shia viewed as the usurpers of the caliphate from the rightful Imams</li>
<li>nusuli&rsquo;s book caused a political crisis</li>
<li>1950&rsquo;s and 1960&rsquo;s, Abdul Aziz al-Duri, a <a href="/posts/iraqi_sunni/">iraqi sunni</a> historian and dean of Baghdad university continued to to raise the idea that the ethnic purity ofthe arabs was not only crucial but was endangered by the persians</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>citizenship rights
<ul>
<li>persian shias have had different pre-national rights, many arabs sought persian &ldquo;naturalization&rdquo; to avoid military service in the <a href="/posts/20200416085817-ottoman/">ottoman</a> standing army</li>
<li>shi&rsquo;ism being equated with persianism reinforces the idea that the shrine cities had persian cultural traits, alongside the strong trade relations and the persian mujitahids</li>
<li>mass deportations in the early 1970&rsquo;s under the baath</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>state control of religious cultural spaces and controlled separation of state and religion
<ul>
<li>since sunni religious establishment was subsumed into the administration, the remaining secularization drive was focused on the shia</li>
</ul>
</li>
