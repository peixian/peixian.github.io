Your book claims that one reason we do not see such revolutionary change is because there’s a lack of freedom.

<ul>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;This methodology doesn&rsquo;t work, just take alzheimers, there&rsquo;s been</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;The essential thing is to build up mutural trust. If the scientists don&rsquo;t trust you, they won&rsquo;t tell you what they really want to do. They&rsquo;re accustomed to being cut off&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;We are looking for anyone that can say current thinking is wrong&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Even if someone comes along and says &lsquo;I can solve this problem&rsquo;, it will still be incomplete. But we need to take another step, and only individuals can take another step.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In this podcast, we spoke with Professor Don Braben, who is the author of Scientific Freedom: The Elixir of Civilization and several other books. Professor Braben ran the Research Venture Unit from 1980 to 1990 in BP, providing over £20 million to over 30 researchers and teams from Europe and north America. He spoke about the necessity of finding and funding scientists, in order to free scientists from the auspices of the funding agencies. Professor Braben elaborated on the specific need for trust and freedom, as well as selection process in order to find talented scientists in order to fund.</p>
