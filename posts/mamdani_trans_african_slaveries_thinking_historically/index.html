          <p>Tags: <a href="/posts/problems_and_methods/">problems and methods</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Talks about how slavery cannot be defined solely as chattel slavery</li>
<li>Argues against the notion put out by Orlando Patterson and Bruce Hall</li>
<li>Islamic forms of slavery were actually a part of the slave market that eventually turned into chattel slavery</li>
<li>Chattel slavery and free people were two sides of the same coin, examples where the people were the most free (like Athens) also had the most chattel slavery</li>
<li>Shift of greeks and romans from half free people to reliance on chattel slaves from outside was the emergence of the idea of freedom</li>
<li>Argues that Patterson, in his attempt to find a coherent definition of slavery, overlooked many differences
<ul>
<li>In Islam, Mamaluks</li>
<li>In Ethopia, various other groups</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Early data about #s of slaves were largely anecdotal and basically wild guesses</li>
<li>Zanj rebellion in Iraq, lead by Ali
<ul>
<li>Large, spartacus like revolt from Southern iraq of free people and poors</li>
<li>Lasted over 15 years</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Race based slavery was a western import, largely allowing for racialized taxonomies with colonialization
<ul>
<li>previously one could &ldquo;become&rdquo; an arab, just as you could convert to islam</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Haterin in northern Morocco</li>
<li>Universal definitions of slavery is a fool&rsquo;s errand, too difficult to actually conceptualize</li>
<li>Segregation produces a clear divide between slave and non-slave, while the dominant discourse on slavery has been defined as the meeting point of abolitionist and Orientialist</li>
</ul>
