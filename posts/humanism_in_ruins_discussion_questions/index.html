<h2 id="discussion-questions">Discussion questions</h2>
<h3 id="from-erin">From Erin</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Is the idea that to be post-ottoman in contemporary turkey is to harken back to a &ldquo;ottoman&rdquo; past that never existed?</p>
<ul>
<li>Within the frame of multi-culturalism, it is, the book traces the lineages of the organizations (league of nations/UN, AWR/AER, UNESCO/European Capital of Culture)</li>
<li>Segregative biopolitics as a management technique? -&gt; Can we push this beyond turkey and look at the other post-ottoman nations?</li>
<li>If we look at it within a temporal frame like this book does, we can see that segregative biopolitics, eugenics, and Gini&rsquo;s ideas all have massive influence today on contemporary turkey, the museumization of cultures within instanbul is circumscribing a culture to a specific &ldquo;zone&rdquo; is segregative biopolitics at its best</li>
<li>I am concerned about pushing this beyond turkey, do we see this frame being replicated outside of turkey?
<ul>
<li>Schyagh talks about specialization of cities within mandates, do we see an economic parallel to this?</li>
<li>Is to be post ottoman to have your culture carved up? Or do have the differences of ottoman culture brought to light?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Strictly culturalist argument made here, why not domestic institutions?
<ul>
<li>Why not FAO, development organizations?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Is the structure of the palimpsets compelling? Can we really say the some of the institutions are directly descended from their previous incarnations?</li>
<li>The structure is compelling due to the fact that these organizations are so closely related to one another (League of Nations/UN, AWR/AER, UNESCO/European Capital of Culture)</li>
<li>The structure of the palimpsets are compelling, we do really see traces of institutions that follow one another through this.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h2 id="how-would-she-respond-to-the-category-of-a-post-ottoman">How would she respond to the category of a &ldquo;post-ottoman&rdquo;?</h2>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is 1923 a valid starting point?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Segregative biopolitics is the starting point of the book, but while I find the tracing of it loose, it is undeniable the notion that this lead later. The management of a problem, rather than the solution of it, is primary to the French formation of Lebanon, to the sectarian systems that reside within the middle east today</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The core critisicsm in the book is that the humanist approaches post 1923 has been patch upon patch of &ldquo;least evils&rdquo; without ever addressing the root problem</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="mine">Mine</h3>
<ul>
<li>Is segregative biopolitics (<a href="/posts/20200414223655-pursely_familiar_futures/">Pursely - Familiar Futures</a>) a way of reconciling a national identity?
<ul>
<li>Taking turkey and greece as both imagined communities, was the &ldquo;unmixing of races a strict</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To live during this time was to buy into the idea that there were ethnic, primordial ties that could be activated via geanology</li>
<li>To be post-ottoman is to have your culture used as a tool, either against you as a sign of your backwards-ness (mandates not yet ready for independence, artificial states, etc) or to use your culture as a sign of enlightenment (balkan states being in the league, mandates not), or to have your culture defined in contrast to the past (museumization) (turkey)
<ul>
<li>Is to be post ottoman a reducion of ottoman culture?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Broad strokes:
<ul>
<li>Reduction of human beings via forced similarities (all the same), then eugenics, then numbers</li>
<li>Recollection of the past</li>
<li>Calcification of the past via museums</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
