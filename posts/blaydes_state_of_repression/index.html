<p>Talks about how collective punishment is meted out by the Saddam regime. Primary thesis concerns the legibility of citizenry, the more &ldquo;legible&rdquo; the citizenry is to the regime, the more targeted punishments become.</p>
<p>Homogenous socities with dictators spawn low trust because the society is relatively easy to be infiltrated.</p>
<p>Collective punishment heightens group identities, such as the case of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stalin &amp; Ukranians</li>
<li>Bedouins in the Sinai</li>
<li>Japanese internment in WWII</li>

<li>Argument: citizen behaviors in autocratic regimes are determined by the <em>intensity</em> and <em>precision</em> of rewards and punishments</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Citizens are governed by both beliefs and incentives
<ul>
<li>But beliefs are a proxy for communal behavior</li>
