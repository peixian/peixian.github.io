<ul>
<li>called <em>ziyara</em></li>
<li>pilgrimage to sacred shi&rsquo;a shrines during private and public occasions</li>
<li>considered the vistitations are considered means of getting intercessions</li>
<li>definitely different than hajj
<ul>
<li>because it has no temporal limitations</li>
<li>although might be similar to umrah?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Vistitations to the shrine of Hussein happen anytime, although ashura nad arbain are the most significant</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="ashura-vistitations--ziyarat-ashura">Ashura Vistitations (<em>ziyarat &lsquo;ashura</em>)</h4>
<ul>
<li>sourced from shia hadith, although attributed to Muhammad al-Baqir, the 5th imam</li>
<li>Sheikh al-Kulayni, Sheikh al-Tusi, and Sheikh Jaafar bin Quluweh al-Qomi has a whole chapter on this in Kamil al-Ziyarat</li>
<li>Also backup perscriptions in case one is unable to reach the shrine, such as practicing from the roof or any high location</li>
<li>Actual ritual:
<ul>
<li>stand in front of the tomb</li>
<li>recite formal Islamic greetings</li>
<li>then speak to the imam as if he is alive listening to his visitors</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Also follow the customs of visitations (<em>adab al-ziyara</em>)
<ul>
<li>Visitor has to be clean in body and clothes</li>
<li>Show respect and humbleness</li>
<li>Before vistitors come into the shrine, they must ask permission from allah, the prophet, and the Imam, and after entering they stand as close as possible to the tomb</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>After
<ul>
<li>pray,</li>
<li>read Quran</li>
<li>pray for repentance and any specific prayer</li>
<li>and ask forgiveness for guilt or sin</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In permission to enter the shrine
<ul>
<li>you read a special request written on a big board hung high next to the gates of the tomb</li>
<li>then visitor comes close to the windows surrounding the tomb to recite a invocation (<em>du&rsquo;a</em>) from specific books to ask for blessings or support
<ul>
<li>usually entices an emotional response to the visitor cries during invocation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>then visitors due the ziyara prayer</li>
<li>read ziyra &lsquo;ashura</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="arb-ain-vistitations--ziyarat-al-arb-ain">Arb&rsquo;ain Vistitations (<em>ziyarat al-arb&rsquo;ain</em>)</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Go on foot to visit the shrine of Imam al-Hussein on the 20th of Safar to celebrate the 40 days for the martyrdom</p>
<ul>
<li>Called &ldquo;restoring the head&rdquo; (<em>maradd al-ras</em>)
<ul>
<li>it was this day that the head of hussein was restored to his body</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>rituals are connected with the return of al-Hussein&rsquo;s family from Damascus asserted by Sayid Ibn Tawoos</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>crying, striking the face, and wearing black are major features</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One of the most important references was mentioned in <em>tatheeb alahkam</em> by al-Tusi</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>some reason ashura is more important but arba&rsquo;een has seen more people</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>major mourning days:</p>
<ul>
<li>3rd, 7th, and 40th, and the annual anniversary after the death</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="latimyas">Latimyas</h2>
<h3 id="al-shur-deviation">Al-shur deviation</h3>
<ul>
<li>in 2011, al-shur became to occur because people started to use &lsquo;sin sin&rsquo; instead of saying &lsquo;hussein hussein&rsquo;</li>
<li>hussein says this is an iranian invention</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="local-deviations">Local deviations</h3>
<ul>
<li>Persian and Urdu latmiyas have different beats</li>
<li>Interview with Ali Tekamji on March 26th, 2022
<ul>
<li>At the international relations department of the shrine of Imam Hussein</li>
<li>Majilis have tents that are typically rented out during special seasons, only for the special holidays do you actually need to rent out a tent</li>
<li>For Karbala natives, starting from the 3rd-9th of Ashura, there are about 20+ local groups who go around and make political latimyas</li>
<li>These are about the electrical problems, the services, etc, not explicitly political, but certainly political in nature</li>
<li>The processions tend to happen around the shrine itself, and it&rsquo;s local karbala city folks that make this</li>
<li>This happens from the 3rd/4th of maghrib to sunrise, every day</li>
<li>Each group has it&rsquo;s own radood, and every day there is a different qasida/qasaid</li>
<li>How did this occur? Who started this practice? When did these practices start?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="majilis-al-3za">Majilis al-3za</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Majlis Al-‘Aza may take the name majlis Husseini because they are held for Al-Hussein as they are called in the Iraqi dialect Majalis Al-Qraya (reading councils), and the person who presents this ritual is called Al-Qari (the reciter or reader).”</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="radood">Radood</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Radood notes, March 24th, 2022 - Shia center for Karabala Studies</p>
<ul>
<li>Interviewee: Radood Muntazir al-Husseini</li>
<li>He is 31 years old, started since he was 10</li>
<li>Originally from <a href="/posts/baghdad/">baghda%d</a></li>
<li>Process of Performing
<ul>
<li>Preparation, one has to pick the qasidas</li>
<li>One has to do wudu, and be spiritually clean and pure</li>
<li>The audience looks to the radood as a holy representative</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Qualities that distinguish a radood?
<ul>
<li>Age is not a factor (also described by the <a href="/posts/karbala/#karbala-id-79c71f4d-34e2-4ae4-aba2-0010b4887f0a-radoods-school-at-husseinya-al-yassine-at-mohammad-amin-street--حسينية-ال-ياسين-في-شارع-محمد-الامين">Karbala Radoods School at Husseinya al Yassine at Mohammad Amin Street (حسينية ال ياسين في شارع محمد الامين)</a>)</li>
<li>Very important to pick the rhythm and lyrics</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Lyrical choice depends on the theme of the event
<ul>
<li>There are 8 themes (maqam)
<ul>
<li><a href="https://alkafeel.net/news/index?id=14391&amp;lang=en">https://alkafeel.net/news/index?id=14391&amp;lang=en</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Example themes:
<ul>
<li>Saba, ajam, etc</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Each theme has different branches, which total over 350</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When Muntazir started, he used qasids from famous ones, before he had poets to write for him</li>
<li>There is a sub-industry of the poets and the writers, each of whom support each other
<ul>
<li>Sometimes you ask a poet based on the theme, sometimes a poet sends you ones to perform if you are famous</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Has given radoods all over the world (Bahrain, Lebanon, Iran, Kuwait,Iraq)</li>
<li>Pointed out that when he went to Lebanon, they didn&rsquo;t understand the idioms</li>
<li>Radoods typically follow three ways:
<ul>
<li>Start with a slow beat</li>
<li>Go with a faster beat</li>
<li>End with one like a &ldquo;pop song&rdquo; and loud</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How many radoods are there in Iraq?
<ul>
<li>(jokingly) more radoods than attendees</li>
<li>There&rsquo;s no exact number, but Muntazir describes that Iraqis have a sad voice, which is what people often look for in radoods</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How do you feel about the changes such as the al-shur stuff post 2011?
<ul>
<li>Latmiyas change with time, but the new stuff is going both ways</li>
<li>Positive: More accessibility due to digital videos</li>
<li>Negative: More people are focusing on the rhythm
<ul>
<li>People like Bassim Karbalei have kept pace with changes</li>
<li>People like Mullah Jayyid have preferred to keep the old ways, which has casued him to drop in popularity</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Why do people focus on rhythms more than lyrics?
<ul>
<li>lyrics are hard to transplant, rhythms are easier</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Are changes happening at a faster pace?
<ul>
<li>yes, previously radoods were not very good and relied on memorization and were often illiterate</li>
<li>new tools have helped develop this, more educated and more academic as time has gone on</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How do you learn to become a radood?
<ul>
<li>there are scholarly rawdids</li>
<li>largely about the structure of the throat</li>
<li>main ways
<ul>
<li>young age, realize you have a good voice, and then eventually you carve out a path</li>
<li>you can also go learn at one of the many schools</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>apprenticeships, now there are many out there</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Who funds the radood schools?
<ul>
<li>All radood schools are private</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Radood notes, March 26, 2022 - Shia Center for Karbala Studies</p>
<ul>
<li>Interviewee: Radood Muntazir al-Husseini, who is at the Karbala Center</li>
<li>Describes how there is a &ldquo;comission from wealthy people&rdquo; to the radood school, which supports all over Iraq</li>
<li>Definitely not a waqf, and not associated with the 3ttaba</li>
<li>There are radood schools in Baghdad, Karbala, Basra, Nasriya, Kut/Ammara
<ul>
<li>In <a href="/posts/baghdad/">baghdad</a>, there is a big one in Kathimya and another in Sadr City</li>
<li>The Kathimyya one seems to produce more radoods now than the Karbala school</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://alkafeel.net/news/index?id=11772&amp;lang=en">https://alkafeel.net/news/index?id=11772&amp;lang=en</a>
<ul>
<li>seems to describe the radood commission</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Turkmen radoods as well seem to have their own thing going up in the north, probably worth validating</li>
<li>Radood commission is fully private, confirmed by Ali Tekmaji at the international relations part of the Hussein shrine</li>
<li>One of the main responsibilities of the commission is to issue licenses and certifications for radoods to perform outside of Iraq
<ul>
<li>Within Iraq, anything goes, anyone can perform at a specific place</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Interview with Ali Tekamji, March 26, 2022 - International Media Office at the Hussein Shrine</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In Karbala city, during the 3rd of Muharram to the 9th of Muharram</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each one has a radood, and the songs are often about the electricity, or the services</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>around ~20 groups, each with 100 people</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The professor from the shrine has his own mokeb, I was wondering if he has any ones related to that, since he&rsquo;s a native karbali</p>
<ul>
<li>Ask the professor and mustafa again?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>2PM shrine has a choir, Hussein shrine is &ldquo;Mullah Sahib al-Karbalai&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The shrine is purchasing land around it, and all the land around it was previously private</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Interview with mokeb administrator - March 27th, 2022</p>
<ul>
<li>There does seem to be a certification process

<h2 id="husseinyya">Husseinyya</h2>
<ul>
<li>Differences between Lebanon husseinyyas and Iraqi husseinyyas
<ul>
<li>Lebanese ones allow politics but the Iraqi ones don&rsquo;t? Need to validate this claim</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Husseinyas are different than mosques, husseinyas can comprise of a mosque and a place of prayer, but also is a place to rituals and practice, broader in scope</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="qasida">Qasida</h2>
<ul>
<li>قصيدة</li>
<li>some poets compose only for specific <a href="#radood">Radoods</a>,
<ul>
<li>Bassim Karbalaei, for example, supposedly receives qasidas in the middle of the night and free wheels it in the morning</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="as-a-pilgrimage">As a Pilgrimage</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;As a poetic project, the notion of pilgrimage induces Indonesian Muslims to travel to Ḥ aḍramawt by framing such a journey as a transformative process.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The iraqi shia also have a deep understanding of this, because they say the spiritual rewards for the pilgrims are high, shifts from being consumers to producers, because crying at a majilis al-aza reflects an re-enactment of a different time, similar to ta&rsquo;zieh</p>
<h2 id="ali-al-wardi">Ali Al-Wardi</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“Ali Al- Wardi (1913-1995), is one of the main pioneers of Iraqi sociology. In his book Lamahat Ijtimaiyya min Tareekh Al-Iraq Al-Hadith (1971), he focused on the nature of the emergence and structure of modern Iraqi society since the Ottoman era until the end of the twentieth century. Al- Wardi builds an argument to demonstrate that the beating celebration (Majalis Al-Latm) and the processions of Al-Hussein (Al-Mawakib Al-Husseinyya) in Iraq during the nineteenth century onward appeared for the first time in Al- Kadhumya city”</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="extra-thoughts">Extra thoughts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Most focus on the economy of mourning, and of crying</li>
<li>What about morning as a political force? Transformation of mourning from mourning the dead and occupying a state into political action, how does this happen?</li>
<li>Places to take this: in Sadr city? in Karbala city?</li>
<li>What is my intervention? The bureacratization of muharram has actually made rituals more political, because as they become bureacrtaized and regularized, we see it seep into politics</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="previous-books">Previous Books</h2>

<h2 id="mowkebs">Mowkebs</h2>
<ul>
<li>Culture of service, everyone feels compelled to do a mowkeb</li>
<li>Specific mowkebs are known for different things (abu ali&rsquo;s tea, thailand mowkeb, etc)</li>
<li>Similar to sufi guest lodges, although not funded by waqf, and requires constant maintanence</li>

<li>Branding and public nature
<ul>
<li>Shia rituals get campy because of a style of iteration and play, because the iteration and public nature engeders a casual one-upping, each iteration begets a more interesting and louder spread</li>
<li>Organic spread of differences, why do people create mowkebs? Because they simply want to serve a different fish</li>
<li>Dragons at the end of safina, what does this mean?
