<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Writes about the toleration of religion and state, wrt to the magistrate and priests</li>
<li>Magistrate power reaches only certain civil confinements
<ul>
<li>locke distinguishes between &ldquo;civil interest&rdquo;: - &ldquo;life, liberty, health, idolency of the body, property&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>notes that the care of souls is not committed to the civil magistrate, it&rsquo;s committed to a higher being
<ul>
<li>as a result, compelling people towards religion is bad</li>
<li>magistrates and magistracy doesn&rsquo;t make humanity or christianity mutually exlcusive
<ul>
<li>notes the parallels of persuasion and command, arguments and penalties
<ul>
<li>religion as persuasion and civil as punishment</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>fundalmentally argues taht laws are of no force w/o penalties
<ul>
<li>is this true?</li>
<li>there are laws that are unenforced who&rsquo;s purpose is to segregate different groups
<ul>
<li>hart&rsquo;s theory of law</li>
<li>jaywalking</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>if we accept that laws and penalties are enforced from top down, this draws a relationship to <a href="/posts/al_fadl_what_type_of_law_is_islamic_law/">al-Fadl: What Type of Law is Islamic Law</a>, who argued that islamic law is &ldquo;bottom up&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;penalties cannot produce belief&rdquo;
<ul>
<li>which is also somewhat strange in light of Iran-Iraq POW&rsquo;s</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>he takes a church to be &ldquo;voluntary&rdquo;, from the ground up</li>
<li>when a magistrate starts imposing sect-based rules, man has replaced god as the arbiter of souls</li>
<li>what gives the church the right to excommunicate people?
<ul>
<li>but excommunication cannot deprive people of physical property</li>
<li>excommunication is a dissolution of the union and the person</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>what does toleration require from people in power?
<ul>
<li>whenever church authority is sprung, the ecclesaticality confines it to the church and makes it unable to be extended to civil</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>if a man&rsquo;s soul is their own, who has authoirty over a neglected soul?</li>
<li>if nothing that belongs to divine worship be left to human discretion, how do churches have the power to order time and place of worship?
<ul>
<li>locke states that religious worship is distinguished between the worship itself and the circumstances around it
<ul>
<li>parts of worship are about worshiping <strong>to</strong> god</li>
<li>circumstances are the necessary part of worship, but not directly <strong>to</strong> him</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>laws w/ church and the magistrate
<ul>
<li>whatever is lawful in the commonwealth cannot be prohibited by the magistrate</li>
<li>whatever is lawful for usage cannot be unlawful for acts of religious worship</li>
<li>when no harm is caused by religious beliefs, the magistrate should not attempt to legisliate</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>if a magistrate cannot legislate for religious beliefs, what if he believes it to be for the public good?
<ul>
<li>private judgement does not give right to be excluded from obligation of law, so the private judgement of a magistrate is not allowed to impose new laws on his subjects</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>views state power as absolute, but holds a strange understanding of what should be tolerated
<ul>
<li>mentions the toleration of civil assemblies vs eccleiastical ones</li>
<li>disagrees with civil assemblies are open, free to enter, where as religious ones are more private</li>
<li>toleration of new assmelbies is not to be prejudiced</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>
<ul>
<li>how do we make the secular tractable?</li>
<li>religious of the sacred, relationship between the sacred and secular?</li>
<li>how do we go from religion, to secular, to political?</li>
<li>locke wrote after the civil war?</li>
<li>are the categories useful?</li>
<li>religion as a tradition?</li>
<li>locke ignores the idea of semi-religious law, such as muslim laws in India</li>
<li>can souls be bartered? is religion a property of man that cannot be taken or used?</li>
<li>power in premodern socities is seen as neutral, and seen as a fundalmental good to be acquired</li>
<li>is kubali khan establishing a hierarchy of state</li>
<li>religion is voluntary for who?</li>
<li>locke is (maybe) looking out for the interests of property owners</li>
<li>predication of reason? is reason the enforcer of the split</li>
<li>toleration, but toleration of what?
<ul>
<li>muslims and catholics cannot participate, as they believe another primus</li>
<li>spiritual subjects - ideal of spiritual subjects?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>locke elevates protestant ideals of a civil religion, and then asks that other religions conforms to it</li>
<li>is locke drawing upon a protestant shared tradition?</li>
<li>locke sees toleration as the tool to protect both religion and property, where drawing clear boundaries allows both to be cultivated</li>
</ul>
