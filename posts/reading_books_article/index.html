<ul>
<li>brothers of a gun was a solidifying moment for me about the middle east</li>
<li>judas is a weird but very interesting novel, although I don&rsquo;t recall much of it, deserves a reread</li>
<li>the shell is a scary book, flip side of syria</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>book I didn&rsquo;t even remember I read: &hellip;most of the books honestly</p>
<ul>
<li>This year I mostly spent reading and jamming through a variety of books, from Aftershocks to a Biography of the Quran to Becoming Fluent</li>

<p>most impactful book: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1633.Getting_Things_Done">https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1633.Getting_Things_Done</a></p>
<ul>
<li>hate that this book is so effective, I really didn&rsquo;t want to become one of those people that adopts it</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>book I didn&rsquo;t even realize I read: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/98418.Literature_from_the_Axis_of_Evil">https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/98418.Literature_from_the_Axis_of_Evil</a>_</p>
<ul>
<li>seem to recall this was interesting but have completely forgotten about it</li>

<li>
<p>books I liked: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17656566-the-locust-effect">https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17656566-the-locust-effect</a>, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23012836-the-great-war-for-civilisation">https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23012836-the-great-war-for-civilisation</a></p>
<ul>
<li>locust effect presented an obvious-but-interesting thesis</li>
<li>fisk&rsquo;s book is interesting for people who are interested in the middle east, it&rsquo;s a massive book and he&rsquo;s a crank now, but written when he wasn&rsquo;t a crank
<ul>
<li>chewed through most of this in amman</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>2020:
still working through it, but I&rsquo;m on track for 52 books.</p>
<ul>
<li>favorite book so far: <a href="/posts/20200414091517-smart_note_taking/">Taking Smart Notes</a>
<ul>
<li>inspired me to start writing more and keeping more notes</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>mostly inspired by a class on the post-ottoman near east
<ul>
<li>a book a week mandated for a class is a great motivator</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lessons learned:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don&rsquo;t really believe in passive reading anymore
<ul>
<li>2018 was my most active year and I barely recall reading it</li>
<li>passive reading is great for soaking up general knowledge, but I feel like I could&rsquo;ve read a series of wikipedia articles and gotten the same effect</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>take reading seriously
<ul>
<li>don&rsquo;t just consume books anywhere</li>
<li>I consume low grade articles in line and spare times</li>
<li>book reading is sacred, which means <strong>actively</strong> planning for it
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;m lucky in that I rarely have other obligations on weekends</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
