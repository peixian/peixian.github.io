<li>
<p>Yemen currently has two bank notes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One printed by the central bank in Aden and one by the one in Sana</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Split occured in late 2016</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The rebels were not happy with the new notes. It&rsquo;s easy to guess why. Fresh money could be used to pay government fighters, not rebel fighters. This &ldquo;blood money&rdquo; would then cheekily flow north via trade. Since anyone who holds a banknote is by definition funding the government that issues it with a no-interest loan, the rebel north was financing its own enemies. (The technical term for this sort of financing is seigniorage).</p>

<li>
<p>CBY was the only institution to preserve national-level functionary for over 5 years apart from the Ministry of Health</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>helped to maintain basic public services</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Despite this, the CBY’s financial coordination with local governing entities persisted. Prior to the outbreak of war, local councils in the country’s various governorates would regularly collect taxes and revenues on behalf of the central government and submit these to their local CBY branch. In return, the CBY would disperse operating funds to the local councils for public sector salaries and the provision of local services, as proportioned in the national budget. This system continued even after the onset of war and the division of the country</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Hadi began to attack the CBY in July 2016, caused the CBY to be denied cash reserves held outside Yemen</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As recently at June 2016 the IMF Mission Chief for Yemen, Albert Jaeger, had publicly stated: “The central bank is certainly serious about being neutral in a very difficult political and security setting, and it has been to a large extent successful in maintaining basic financial stability throughout the conflict.”</p>
