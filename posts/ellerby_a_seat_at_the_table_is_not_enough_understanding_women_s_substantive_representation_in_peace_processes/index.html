<p>Ellerby, Kara. “A Seat at the Table Is Not Enough: Understanding Women’s Substantive Representation in Peace Processes.” Peacebuilding 4, no. 2 (May 3, 2016): 136–50. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/21647259.2016.1192240">https://doi.org/10.1080/21647259.2016.1192240</a>.</p>
<p>When do women actually particpate in peace processes? When they do, do peace processes substantively include more provisions to reflect women&rsquo;s interests?</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/posts/unscr_1325/">UNSCR 1325</a></li>
<li>undertakes a textual analysis of all negotiated civil war peace agreements</li>
</ul>
<p>Argues that women&rsquo;s representation is not just one where they are at the table, but must include a:</p>
<ul>
<li>Agenda</li>
<li>Access</li>
<li>Advocacy</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="agenda">Agenda</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="/posts/guatemala/">guatemala</a> - women created written general demands for development, repatriation, and reintegration</li>
<li><a href="/posts/burundi/">burundi</a> - special women&rsquo;s conference within the Arusha Peace and Reconcilation agreement</li>
<li><a href="/posts/sudan/">sudan</a> - Darfur&rsquo;s Peace Agreement used various women&rsquo;s groups during the <a href="/posts/african_union_au/">african union (au)</a> mediators</li>
<li><a href="/posts/uganda/">uganda</a> - women did not have specific or written agenda, but did have a Uganda Women&rsquo;s Coalition for Peace&rsquo;s work in communities</li>
<li><a href="/posts/philippines/">philippines</a> -  <a href="/posts/comphrensive_agreement_on_the_bangsamoro/">Comphrensive Agreement on the Bangsamoro</a> - inlcuded the Mindanao Women Conference on Peace and Security</li>
<li>Women can shape the agenda in different ways, sometimes with specific demands and  sometimes with general agreements</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="access">Access</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="/posts/guatemala/">guatemala</a> - Women participated in the formal civil society access to peace process, secured via the <a href="/posts/civil_society_assembly/">Civil Society Assembly</a></li>
<li><a href="/posts/democratic_republic_of_the_congo/">democratic republic of the congo (DRC)</a> - Women worked with the <em>forces vives</em>, civil society sector involved in ICD</li>
<li><a href="/posts/burundi/">burundi</a>, <a href="/posts/uganda/">uganda</a> - women were granted &ldquo;observer&rdquo; status, women constantly lobbying for access granted them access</li>
<li><a href="/posts/sudan/">sudan</a> - IO&rsquo;s promoted the women&rsquo;s agenda, depended on the mediators for access that was both indirect and not mandated</li>
<li><a href="/posts/philippines/">philippines</a> - women had both direct and indirect access to the peace process, <a href="/posts/moro_islamic_liberation_front_milf/">Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF)</a> promoted women&rsquo;s access</li>
<li>direct access allows women a seat at the table</li>
<li>observer status may strengthen engagement with formal negotiations by maintaining their independence and ability to critque and criticise
<ul>
<li>potential of having women&rsquo;s pov filtered through &ldquo;mediators&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="advocating">Advocating</h2>
<ul>
<li>Women&rsquo;s demands are complementary to peace and not in competition to them</li>
<li><a href="/posts/sudan/">sudan</a> - CPA - original delegates had dropped women&rsquo;s rights, treating women only as victims and not as fighters, but results from AU promoted women as an actual mediator
<ul>
<li>CPA did not avocate for women, but the Darfur process was different</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="/posts/guatemala/">guatemala</a> - Learned from <a href="/posts/el_salvador/">el salvador</a>&rsquo;s failures to address women&rsquo;s issues</li>
<li><a href="/posts/democratic_republic_of_the_congo/">democratic republic of the congo (DRC)</a> - Enagaged women&rsquo;s demands for better representation</li>
<li><a href="/posts/philippines/">philippines</a> - women&rsquo;s issues were considered complementary to the larger goals of the talks</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="barriers">barriers</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="/posts/uganda/">uganda</a> - approached it women friendly, but what was included was not enough, peace was &ldquo;forged at the expense of women&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="/posts/sudan/">sudan</a> - women had to slip suggestions under doors and were marginalized because they were percieved as not having fought in the war</li>
<li><a href="/posts/moro_islamic_liberation_front_milf/">Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF)</a> - had never included women prior to 2012</li>
</ul>
