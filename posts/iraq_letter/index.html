<h2 id="draft-doing-fieldwork-in-iraq">Draft - &ldquo;Doing Fieldwork In Iraq&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Iraq is by far the most libertarian state I&rsquo;ve lived in. For the most part, the government doesn&rsquo;t really do anything besides prop up the currency, and for many Iraqis, especially those who live further out, they can go their entire lives without ever interacting with the government. Iraq, in my experience, is characterized by the <strong>lack</strong> of state, rather than the presence of one. It&rsquo;s got all the trappings of state instuitions, but like an image drawn in relief, we can see life in Iraq drawn in its relief.</p>
<p>I spent the last few years doing fieldwork in Iraq, with stints in 2021, and living there for significant amounts of time starting 2022, and left earlier this year. One of my first experiences in Iraq was arriving on the day of Ashura, and watching this massive throng of people move towards the shrine of Imam Hussein. One of my last experiences was going with the same throng to the shrine of Imam Kazim<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>There&rsquo;s a saying in Iraq that goes &ldquo;ماكو شبر&rdquo;, meaning &ldquo;there isn&rsquo;t an inch&rdquo;. There&rsquo;s certainly a lot of places in Iraq that I haven&rsquo;t been, but I&rsquo;d like to think I&rsquo;ve been around the block, from the river town of Hit to Basra and to the northern Turkish border. Iraq&rsquo;s got a lot to offer, with a dizzing array of religions, dialects, and people. This post is a collection of my experiences and reflections from my time there. I hope it offers a different take on Iraq, since most people&rsquo;s experiences are mediated through Baghdad, which is a world onto its own.</p>
<p>My time in Iraq was largely focused on a single group of people: the Shi&rsquo;a, on specifically the <a href="/blog/2022/08/06/political-radat-and-mowkeb-abbasiyya/">religious ritual of radat</a>. This ritual was developed in Karbala, one of the two holy shrine cities for Shi&rsquo;a Islam within Iraq, about a hour south of Baghdad. Karbala is a small city, with around 1.2 million people, although this number swells greatly during pilgrimage season, which is denoted for two days: Ashura, the 10th day of the Islamic month of Muharram, and Arbaeen, which is 40 days after Ashura. Betwen these dates, millions of pilgrims descend onto Karbala, offering their prayers, hopes, and entreatments. The only thing I&rsquo;ve experience on this scale was Chinese New Year migration in China, which constitutes the world&rsquo;s largest migration of people, although the big difference is that China has the infrastructure to cope with this, whereas Iraqi state barely does, meaning that the people step in to pick up the slack.</p>
<p>The city of Karbala is built on site where the Battle of Karbala happened. In short, Hussein, the grandson of the prophet Mohammad, rose up against the tyrant Yazid. Hussein, whose army has been betrayed by the people of Kufa, another nearby city, is horribly outnumbered while Yazid&rsquo;s army encircles his and begins to deny access to water. Hussein predictably falls in battle, has his head put on a pike, and has his head taken to Yazid. Any Shi&rsquo;a child could tell you this story, and for the Shi&rsquo;a, is not only a holy event, but a dramatic one. Like the sacrifice of Jesus, both the Arab Shi&rsquo;a and Iranian Shi&rsquo;a perform plays to reenact this, for the Arabs this is called tasabiyah, for the Iranians it&rsquo;s ta&rsquo;ziyeh. On ta&rsquo;ziyeh, Hamid Debashi says<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ta&rsquo;ziyeh remembers and reenacts a doomed battle between a small band of revolutionaries and an entrenched and deeply corrupt political power. There is a universality to the battle of Karbala that can easily be extrapolated to include any small band of revolutionaries fighting against any entrenched political power.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There&rsquo;s a certain aptness to the repetition of religious rituals, one of the most dramatic seens I witnesed was when I first arrived in Karbala, seeing thousands of people in sync at a majlis inside the shrine.</p>
<h2 id="foreigners">Foreigners</h2>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>There&rsquo;s two types of foreigners in Iraq: the ones who have a screw loose, and the ones that wander in. The vast majority of the foreigners are in the Kurdish north, which I&rsquo;ll refer to as Iraqi Kurdistan or the KRG. The KRG has three major cities: Duhok, Erbil, and Suleimaniya.</p>
<p>Erbil is a bizarre mixture of both types of foriegners. For example, you can end up at a place like the Grill, the Vinery, or the Sheraton Pool, where you&rsquo;ll mingle with defense contractors, NGO workers, and journalists. These hangs are interesting at first, but usually devolve into the same types of conversations after a little bit, and things can begin to feel a little frat or college like. The academics, on the other hand, are all a little depressed. The effect on locals is different too, Erbil has grown to become basically a foreigner&rsquo;s town, with tons of money catered towards forienger tastes. Sitting on the fault line of the PDK and the PUK, who seem to disagree on everything except one thing: investment in Erbil. Investment has made Erbil a boomtown, with tons of new construction going up everywhere. Unfortunately, the city is structured like a 12 year old playing SimCity, meaning it&rsquo;s hidiously unwalkable, and has strange amentities plopped everywhere, including a golf course that required diverting water from wells that were actively being used.</p>
<p>Kurdistan as a whole is in an interesting place. The politics have started to become apparent that the PUK have become sidelined, the future has become a little bit more unclear as the PDK collaborates with Turkey frequently. Baghdad&rsquo;s perpetual crises seems to have eased up a bit, which has then drawn the federal government&rsquo;s attention back to Kurdistan. NGO money also seems to be on the outs in some cases, when the war in Ukraine broke out, I witnessed a ton of the demining NGO&rsquo;s pull up stakes and move up to Europe. Missionaries are everywhere in the KRG, I can&rsquo;t board a plane to Erbil without chatting up a missionary at this point.</p>
<p>Refugee management is also in a strange spot. The Kurdish government has largely used Syrians as a cheap source of labor, seeing the crises in Syria spigot to be managed. This means that the border crossing between Syria and Iraqi Kurdistan is repeatedly closed and reopened, often without any forewarning. However, given the state of infrastructure, most NGOs that work out of Syria still need to base themselves in the KRG.</p>
<p>Down south, more interesting things are happening. While there are many foreigners in Baghdad, most of them are confined to the Green Zone, where the ones who remain there are basically locked in their compounds, and rarely leave because of kidnapping risk. Baghdad remains a strange place, when I was living there, I felt that the security situation was completely fine if you had your wits about you. Kidnapping risk remained low, and plenty of foreign tourists have been streaming in, eager to make an attempt at becoming some kind of traveler influencer.</p>
<ul>
<li>baghdad jadriya photo?</li>
</ul>
<p>This has fosetered a mini-industry catered towards foriegn tourists, especially youtubers. Iraqis in the south largely understand the concept of a Youtuber, and are eager to show for the camera as well. However, as my friend Emily put it, the Youtubers make the dangerous places seem safe and the safe places seem dangerous. Since their content is targeted at an audience which is largely ignorant of Iraq, these Youtubers end up traffiking in stereotypes about Iraq, flattening its danger curve. This runs the risk of a future Youtuber getting himself into trouble by doing something silly in the future.</p>
<p>Outside of Baghdad, I rarely encountered other foriegners. During my time in Karbala, I was the only foriegner that I saw and was aware of doing active work in the city. There was another academic in Najaf, although we never managed to link up. The bulk of the foreigners in the south are either NGO workers or journalists.</p>
<p>Mosul is seeing a massive boom. Tons of reconstruction money is pouring in, alongside new businesses and a desire for regeneration has made Mosul one of the more interesting places to be right now in Iraq. Plenty of NGO reconstruction money has also made it a focal point for academics, and its relative safety compared to Baghdad has given the city a particular type of freedom. Sadly, I never managed to spend much time in Mosul, since it was outside my range of study. In norther federal Iraq, I spent a few days in Tel Afar, which is (now) a Shi&rsquo;a enclave within the Sunni province. While I&rsquo;m generally quite happy-go-lucky with Iraq, the moment I stepped out of the taxi onto Tel Afar soil I felt like the land did not want me. I&rsquo;ve never felt such malice in the land, and Sinjar&rsquo;s reputation for being a hotzone still persists.</p>

<p>Modern middle east studies often devalues the roles of tribes, usually consigning them to one big bloc of &ldquo;Bedouin&rdquo; or some other general catchall. Iraq is interesting because it continues to maintain a huge tribal influence, even in the cities. Tribal lines intersect with sectarian lines, and many</p>
