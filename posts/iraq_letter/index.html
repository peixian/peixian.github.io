<li>
<p>21-3-2022</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lots of people praying, standing, and wiping their stuff onto the Abbas cage</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Seems like standing in the middle in reflection while rubbing prayer beads is allowed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What function do the prayer beads serve for Shias?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Saw two shrine staff tell dudes with women (a mother once and a sister another) to move to a different section of the shrine (presumably the women&rsquo;s area)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People are sleeping in the shrine, they are passed out and sleeping</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many children run around</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Definitely smells of moving air and feet</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sitting next to a sheikh (?) who said something to me but I didn&rsquo;t respond, and it looks like he&rsquo;s looking at some videos on his phone</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Seeing many old women be wheeled around me</p>
<p>Majilis al-3za, March 24th</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Little kids playing around</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>started at 1, currently 1:17, nobody is crying or anything</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Seems to be quite back and forth</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are there women&rsquo;s majilis? Or do women see it as a separate thing or streaming?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How long are the majilis usually?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Usual crowd, clustered around the front, scattered in the back</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Elicits specific phrases or prayers at times during refrains or something else</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Very short, only 30 min, everyone goes to speak with the sheikh afterwards</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Looks like they leave the stage up afterwards?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During ashura the majilis was a lot more intense, this one seems to be just very quick and very simple</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sidebar: some youth are reading Quran together, with one receiving and leading the way</p>
</li>

<p>certain amount of foxhole bonding</p>

<li>
<p>Water, iraqis feel like their water is being stolen, but there&rsquo;s also horrific mismanagement of the water</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Erbil is a place for bad imperialists</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Baghdad is a place where magic happens, but it&rsquo;s also crazy and sometimes dangerous and frustrating</p>

<p>Euphrates, much better than the tigris</p>

<li>ecology is the last to go</li>
<li>sandstorms frequently, it&rsquo;s not great</li>
<li>shifting to ecology, last few years climate has become very hip
<ul>
<li>kurdistan ecology is booming, lots of hiking trails and is an outdoor destination now</li>
