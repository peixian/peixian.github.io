<li>
<p>21-3-2022</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lots of people praying, standing, and wiping their stuff onto the Abbas cage</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Seems like standing in the middle in reflection while rubbing prayer beads is allowed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What function do the prayer beads serve for Shias?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Saw two shrine staff tell dudes with women (a mother once and a sister another) to move to a different section of the shrine (presumably the women&rsquo;s area)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People are sleeping in the shrine, they are passed out and sleeping</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many children run around</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Definitely smells of moving air and feet</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sitting next to a sheikh (?) who said something to me but I didn&rsquo;t respond, and it looks like he&rsquo;s looking at some videos on his phone</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Seeing many old women be wheeled around me</p>
<p>Majilis al-3za, March 24th</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Little kids playing around</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>started at 1, currently 1:17, nobody is crying or anything</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Seems to be quite back and forth</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are there women&rsquo;s majilis? Or do women see it as a separate thing or streaming?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How long are the majilis usually?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Usual crowd, clustered around the front, scattered in the back</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Elicits specific phrases or prayers at times during refrains or something else</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Very short, only 30 min, everyone goes to speak with the sheikh afterwards</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Looks like they leave the stage up afterwards?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During ashura the majilis was a lot more intense, this one seems to be just very quick and very simple</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sidebar: some youth are reading Quran together, with one receiving and leading the way</p>

<p>Water, iraqis feel like their water is being stolen, but there&rsquo;s also horrific mismanagement of the water</p>

<p>I spent the last few years doing fieldwork in Iraq, with stints in 2021, and living there for significant amounts of time starting 2022, and left earlier this year.</p>

<p>Down south, more interesting things are happening.</p>
<ul>
<li>baghdad jadriya photo?</li>
</ul>
<p>This has fosetered a mini-industry catered towards foriegn tourists, especially youtubers. Iraqis in the south largely understand the concept of a Youtuber, and are eager to show for the camera as well. However, as my friend Emily put it, the Youtubers make the dangerous places seem safe and the safe places seem dangerous. Since their content is targeted at an audience which is largely ignorant of Iraq, these Youtubers end up traffiking in stereotypes about Iraq, flattening its danger curve. This runs the risk of a future Youtuber getting himself into trouble by doing something silly in the future.</p>
<p>Outside of Baghdad, I rarely encountered other foriegners. During my time in Karbala, I was the only foriegner that I saw and was aware of doing active work in the city. There was another academic in Najaf, although we never managed to link up. The bulk of the foreigners in the south are either NGO workers or journalists.</p>
<h2 id="tribes">Tribes</h2>

</ul>
<p>Modern middle east studies often devalues the roles of tribes, usually consigning them to one big bloc of &ldquo;Bedouin&rdquo; or some other general catchall. Iraq is interesting because it continues to maintain a huge tribal influence, even in the cities. Tribal lines intersect with sectarian lines, and many</p>
