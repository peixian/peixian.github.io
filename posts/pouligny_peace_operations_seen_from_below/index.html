</ul>
</li>
<li>&ldquo;Law&rdquo; as a concept is not widely respected
<ul>
<li>Do locals describe the state as they describe the UN mission?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="sizing-up-the-aims-of-a-un-mission">Sizing Up the Aims of a UN Mission</h2>
<ul>
<li>Political actors greatly affected if the mission was deployed as part of a peace agreement</li>
<li>UN officials assume a static &ldquo;peace&rdquo; and worry about exaggerated hopes, but reality is locals see the UN as part of a new power struggle</li>

</ul>
<h2 id="soverignty-and-intervention">Soverignty and Intervention</h2>
<ul>
<li>Why are peacekeepers not greeted as liberators?
<ul>
<li>Similar: why are peacekeepers not thought of as occupying forces?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Locals may refer to the UN forces in colonial language</li>
<li>&ldquo;Aid culture&rdquo; - some countries have been flooded with aid, and percieve the UN as a continuiation of that aid</li>
<li>Political groups within countries typically engage with the UN on a local level and have conflicts with the UN, very rarely band together against the UN on a larger level</li>
<li>Rejection of the UN is rare because the UN is perceived as doing so little</li>
<li>Soldiers and violations of the local customs, especially prostitution often harms reputation</li>
<li>UN ignores rumors about its missions at its own peril
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;We do not take them seriously because they do not take us seriously&rdquo; syndrome</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When countries emerge from conflict, main interests of the political entrepenurs differ wildly than most people
<ul>
<li>Which is why most demonstrations against the UN are very local</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The UN imposes on the political arena, and cannot remove itself from that</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="strategies-of-local-actors">Strategies of Local Actors</h2>
<ul>
<li>Speaking with the UN conferrs legitmacy
<ul>
<li>More visible the UN is, the more it is sought after</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In Bosnia, media warw as waged</li>
<li>Some NGO&rsquo;s derive their funding and existance completely from the UN
<ul>
<li>El Salvador and Haiti had local NGO&rsquo;s, this relationship is more unclear there</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>UN is perceived to facilitate international aid
<ul>
<li>When the UN is a transitional authority, the peace mission takes on an economic action</li>
<li>UN can act as a spoiler for those with previously agreed transition plans</li>
<li>Actors in Mozambique and Somalia sold their participation in the UN process, with political actors, warlords, imams, etc</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>UN staff can be percieved to be controlling aid access
<ul>
<li>Maifoso networks in bosnia</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Business shifts to accomodate UN workers
<ul>
<li>Especially in capital</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Overlaying the intl political map on the local</li>
<li>Looting of UN property upon withdraw</li>
<li>Local actors will &ldquo;try their luck&rdquo; and &ldquo;keep trying&rdquo;</li>
<li>Local actors will also try to force the UN into taking a side
<ul>
<li>Bosnian muslims routinely made things worse in hopes of attracting a military intervention</li>
<li>Local villages in Cambodia owuld cause issues to get the UN to go in</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Implication of the UN very often land disputes</li>
<li>UN as an alibi and scapegoat
<ul>
<li>Easy to scapegoat UN actors</li>
<li>Local actors complain about funds, drawing together the very real issues of peace and money</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>&ldquo;elections at any cost&rdquo;
<ul>
<li>Elections seen as key milestone for success</li>
<li>Local actors recongize this, and will repeatedly threaten to bow out of elections</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Some local political actors apply force because they may not survive the peace process</li>
<li>Delays in peace process implementation are common, difficult for the UN to admit failure</li>
<li>Looming international deadlines</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="forgotten-promises">Forgotten Promises</h2>
<ul>
<li>UN always comes in with a set of preconcieved notions</li>
<li>Most frameworks use elections as a barometer for success
<ul>
<li>UN uses elections for places where it is an occupying force</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Goals &amp; aims of a &ldquo;procedural democracy&rdquo; are formed
<ul>
<li>Premature elections after a war actually risks stoking old fears, elections are not a quick fix</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Eletion rigging, emphasis on security criteria dog UN elections</li>
<li>&ldquo;Legitimacy&rdquo;, &ldquo;Democracy&rdquo;, and UN&rsquo;s desired results often clash</li>
<li>International election monitoring is often conducted in a very technically oriented way</li>
<li>Elections @ any price opens ot election fraud, leading to perverse goal setting for future elections</li>
<li>Economic reconstruction only approaches it from the symptomes, does not attempt to solve the core issues
<ul>
<li>Peace processes often accompianed by worsening of living conditions, which sharpens conflict</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>UN missions have largely shifted from maintence of ceasefires to &ldquo;policing action&rdquo;
<ul>
<li>Policing action means intervening within the social fabric</li>
<li>Policing as a coercive tool</li>
<li>UN is often not responsible for the intial training
<ul>
<li>ICITAP funded by the US is
<ul>
<li>Similar to teacher&rsquo;s college in <a href="/posts/20200413223156-iraq/">iraq</a>? See <a href="/posts/20200414223655-pursely_familiar_futures/">Pursely - Familiar Futures</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>New police blunders are often overlooked as &ldquo;youthful&rdquo; mistakes</li>
<li>UN missions lack local trust, local knowledge, and cannot effectively intervene on the social contract</li>
<li>Usage of force opens the possbility of a peace mission turning into an occupation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Judicial systems
<ul>
<li>Weak judicial systems contribute to the issues, UN does not attempt large-scale reforms of judicial systems</li>
<li>Reconcilation of status (&ldquo;who are we as a people&rdquo;/&ldquo;who is the state&rdquo;) is often neglected in the peace process</li>
<li>Demand for justice is sacrifed for the demand for peace
<ul>
<li>Lacuna of history is imparted onto new generations</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Technical expertise of the UN reduces the peace process to be without political substance</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
