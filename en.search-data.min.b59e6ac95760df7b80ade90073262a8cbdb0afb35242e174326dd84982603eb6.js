At the same time, Iraq has developed into a unwritten sectarian form of government, where particular cabinet posts are reserved for different groups. This paper evaluates, what, if any, role UNAMI has played in preventing the formation of sectarian identities, in reading UNAMI&rsquo;s reports from 2003 to 2010. Borrowing Fanar Hadadd&rsquo;s four layer framework in understanding sectarian identities, I find that UNAMI&rsquo;s engagements with key political events have not addressed the formation of sectarian identities.
Introduction Identity formation and notions of belonging are at the very heart of the modern Iraqi state. Following 2003, individual ministries have been given to sectarian groups, in an unwritten system known as the muhasa ta&rsquo;ifia. The Kurds, the Shia, and the Sunnis each assert a different claim upon particular cabinet posts. While most studies have focused upon the effects of the American state upon the Iraqi government, few have conducted a review of the effects of the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq (UNAMI). This paper attempts to define the exact effects of UNAMI, between 2003 and 2010, focusing on the reports UNAMI has provided.
What follows is a reading of UNAMI reports to the Secretary General, from 2003 to 2010. Within the reports, UNAMI has responded to major political events in three ways: repeated calls for unity, linking de-escalation of identities with land boundaries, and a checklist style inclusion of minorities. Borrowing a framework for understanding sectarian identities from Fanar Haddad, I discuss each of these three engagements and how they have inadvertently supported the rise of sectarian identities. Adding onto the three ways UNAMI has engaged, I also note that UNAMI has curiously not engaged on the religious or doctrinal level with sectarian identities. I end with discussing how UNAMI&rsquo;s engagements within the reports are almost always with the manifestation of sectarian identities, and as a result fail to halt the entrenchment of the identities themselves.
Methodology This paper is an analysis of UNAMI reports, between 2003 and 2010, found through the UNAMI websites. UNAMI reports are prepared for the UN Secretary General, mandated under multiple UN resolutions: paragraph 30 in resolution 1546 in 2004, paragraph 6 in resolution 1770 in 2007, and finally revised under paragraph 6 of resolution 1883 in 2009. Each report is split into three main sections: a section regarding the key political developments within Iraq, a summary of what UNAMI has accomplished, and observations. This paper will primarily focus on the summary and observations of the UNAMI reports, comparing the discourse to major political events and trends.
A methodological note must be made. UNAMI reports are not for a private audience, nor are they opinion pieces. UNAMI, by virtue of being a political support mission, must maintain good relations with the Iraqi government. As a result, it is highly likely that UNAMI reports are &ldquo;sanitized&rdquo; before release, and possible that analysis on them fails to account for rigorous internal debate. However, in light of the bully pulpit that UNAMI holds, as it holds &ldquo;enjoys good relations with a wide range of actors from across the political spectrum&rdquo; citep:united_nations_report_2007-2, it is important to carry out an analysis of how UNAMI has responded to events within its political reports, and what UNAMI fails to report on.
The time frame of 2003 to 2010 is chosen for two major reasons: it is bookended by the US invasion of Iraq and the 2003 constitutional drafting process, and the re-election of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, which provides a useful case study on a government that appears pluralistic but in fact entrenches sectarian identities. In addition, ending with 2010 allows for a study of sectarianism that is not overshadowed by the formation of the Islamic State. While the Islamic State is a form of sect-based violence, it remains outside the scope of a study on the effects and developments of sectarian identities, as it remains a violent outlier expression of sectarian identities. Most sect-based violence is on a far lesser scale, and more pervasive to society. In addition, limiting the analysis to before 2011 allows the study to remain unaffected by the Arab Spring, another potentially confounding factor in the discourse.
Background Scholarship on contemporary Iraq has been fixated on &ldquo;sectarianism&rdquo;, and yet there are little clear definitions of what &ldquo;sectarianism&rdquo; is. One particular discourse is the Sunni/Shia schism, drawing a historical line between the schism of Islam and contemporary actors today. This primordialist approach holds that identities are static and unchanging, and that recent violence and sectarianism are nothing more than expressions of old hatreds. The opposition to this view is the instrumentalists, who perceive sectarianism as being influenced by elites, who maneuver symbols and discourses of sect for their own goals. Yet, as Fanar Haddad points out, these two views are both flawed, the primordialists fetishize religious doctrine while the elite-based discourse the instrumentalists claim ignore the fact that elites are the products of their own societies .
Yet the debates between these two sides, and the ability to move beyond these views need not detain us. Rather than reading sectarianism as mutually exclusive viewpoints between doctrine and politics, other scholars have provided different frameworks for the analysis of sectarianism. Hinnebusch provides a viewpoint of sectarianism through a three-tier model, stating that identity formation in a sect based manner happens at a supra-state, state, and sub-state level citep:hinnebusch_identity_2020. Haddad extends and transposes this model, rather than seeing it as an onion in which each identity encircles another, Haddad first adds a doctrinal level and suggests that each level is another way to view the sectarian identity box, that doctrine, sub-state, state, and supra-state are four sides to sectarian identity that must all be analyzed in tandem. Just as a polygon only becomes a rectangle when all four sides are drawn and closed, sectarian identity can only be understood when all four are observed at once.
Haddad&rsquo;s framework is used to analyze the events of the January 2005, December 2005, and March 2010 elections on the sub-state and state level. In addition, the question of Kirkuk and Article 140 of the 2003 Constitution of Iraq will be analyzed using the state and supra-state level. UNAMI&rsquo;s engagements with minority inclusion within government formation is also analyzed on the state level. The goal is to provide different snapshots of political flashpoints in which UNAMI could have intervened, and in particular flashpoints that were integral to the solidification of the sect-based Iraqi political system.
Repeated Calls for Unity The UNANMI reports, in almost every report starting 2005, has made a point to call for national reconciliation and settlement of disputed territories. For example, a report from November 11th, 2009 highlights the &ldquo;three successful elections and a national referendum, generally considered credible and broadly participatory&rdquo; citep:united_nations_report_2009-3. In another dated July 29th, 2010, the UNAMI report describes the successful electoral process on June 2nd, and warns that a prolonged government formation process would lead to a loss of credibility for the ruling government citep:united_nations_report_2010-1. The January 2005 provincial elections and the December 2005 parliamentary are important steps in the formation of Sunni sectarian identity, and the December 2010 elections helped to entrench sectarian identities on all sides.
Bland statements that treat peaceful elections as successes flatten history and view it as a singular step function that, once achieved, has no further ramifications. Counting the number of successful elections, or elections without significant violence fails to account for the differences in voter patterns. The 2005 elections were marked with the formation of the United Iraqi Alliance, consisting of mostly conservative Shia parties citep:adam_carr_republic_2005, whereas overtly sectarian messaging began to abate by 2009, only to return in 2010 as Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki campaigned on a Shia identity .
Sunni groups originally boycotted the January 2005 provincial elections, under the assumption that Sunni populations were a majority of Iraq . As a result the local governments in the provinces of Ninewa, Salahadin, and Diyala became controlled by minority Kurdish and Shia parties. However, the UNAMI report blandly states &ldquo;a large number of Iraqis in many parts of the country exercised their right to vote or ran as candidates&rsquo;&rsquo;, stating only that &ldquo;turnout in areas with a majority of Arab Sunnis was markedly lower than for other communities&rdquo; citep:united_nations_report_2005. Notably, the terms &ldquo;sectarian&rdquo; or &ldquo;sectarianism&rdquo; does not appear until the September 2005 report, which it only mentions in passing as &ldquo;rising sectarian tensions&rdquo; citep:united_nations_report_2005-2, an ominous foreshadowing for the outbreak of civil war a year later.
UNAMI&rsquo;s 2005 analyses fail to grasp the political space these nascent sectarian identities were competing within. The outbreak of sectarian violence a year later, after a supposedly successful election, is not a rise in &ldquo;sectarian tensions&rdquo;. Rather, Sunnis had attempted to compete on the sub-state level by boycotting the elections, in an attempt to completely overturn the US-developed framework. When they realized their blunder, they pivoted to compete on the state level by participating in the elections. When the December 2005 national level elections failed to yield a Sunni majority, sectarian tensions boiled over within Sunni provinces. While the UNAMI reports portray the Sunnis as switching sides from non-participation to participation and an unrelated outbreak of violence a year later, the Sunnis had simply pivoted tactics. In other words, Sunnis had never switched sides, they had remained on their own side the entire time, and were simply switching tactics.
Furthermore, The UNAMI approach of addressing grievances through the mechanisms of the state leads UNAMI to be blind to the sectarian actions that different arms of the government carry out. During the run up to March 2010 elections, the de-Baaification committee, which had begun as a way to root out candidates with Baathist dies excluded more than 500 candidates from running for political office , yet this event remarkably fails to show up in any of the UNAMI reports. The reports hold several mentions of the debates that occurred during the original draft De-Baathification laws in 2007 citep:united_nations_report_2007, citep:united_nations_report_2007-1, but it seems that once the committee had been impaneled, UNAMI failed to report on its activities, even when the committee barred candidates on spurious grounds. Practically anyone who held a civil service role during the Saddam Hussein era had some Baathist ties, and the committee exploited this in favor of Shia sectarians, banning Sunnis weeks before the election and throwing the electoral lists into chaos .
In March 2010, the parliamentary elections yielded a poor result for then-incumbent Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki. al-Maliki&rsquo;s State of Law coalition proceeded to win 89 votes, while the predominantly Shia National Iraqi Alliance won 70 votes. The surprise was the Iraqi National Movement (Iraqiya), a coalition of parties from Sunni provinces with significant support in the Shia south, which had won 91 votes citep:adam_carr_republic_2010. A plain reading of the Iraqi constitution would mean Iraqiya&rsquo;s 91-vote plurality in the 325 seat parliament gave Iraqiya the first mandate to form a government. In a bid to stay in power, Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki urged Supreme Judge Medhat al-Mahmood for a ruling on the constitutional requirement that the largest party following the elections first receive a mandate to form the government. al-Maliki asked whether the law meant the largest party after vote tallying, or the largest party to cobble together a coalition within government. Judge Medhat helpfully ruled the latter, effectively invalidating the election, ruling that any party which could cobble together a coalition of votes, or 163 parliamentarians, would receive the first mandate . al-Maliki proceeded to cobble together a government of national unity, on the surface composing of a cross-sectarian group, but instead bound together by the arrangement that parliament would not hold individual ministers accountable for their actions .
The UNAMI reports have zero mention of the ruling and its effects on the Iraqi parliamentary system, rather it mentions the &ldquo;collective process and reaching agreements that appear to have ended the deadlock in the government formation process&rdquo; and welcoming the nomination of al-Maliki as the Prime Minister designate citep:united_nations_report_2010-2. Welcoming al-Maliki&rsquo;s nomination has a very real cost of legitimacy, as it ignores the clearly sectarian de-Baathification committee&rsquo;s actions, the rulings of Judge Medhat, and the further entrenchment of sectarian powers. This provides a conceptual parallel to UN stabilization missions and peacebuilding, where stabilization missions often come at the cost of defining which groups are included and excluded in political dialogues citep:curran_stabilization_2020, which may appear to stabilize volatile situations in the short term at the expense of long-term goals. UNAMI, in supporting a government which was effectively unaccountable, provided political space for further sectarian divisions on the national level, similar to how UN missions in the Congo have problems in appearing complicit in human rights violations by the Congolese government.
Linkage of De-escalation of Identities with Land Boundaries Alongside the Sunni and Shia identities, the Kurdish identities is a unique one that straddles international boundaries. During the 2003 American invasion, the Kurdish militias seized Kirkuk, an oil rich city with great cultural importance to Iraqi Kurds, and established it as a &ldquo;green line&rdquo; . The question of whether Kirkuk belonged to the autonomous Kurdish region of Iraqi was written into the Iraqi constitution as Article 140, which sets out a process for determining the disputed territory, first through a committee formation process, and then followed by a census and While the constitution stipulated that the process was to be carried out by 2007, Article 140 was never implemented, and briefly threatened to start a scheduled civil war.
UNAMI was greatly involved in the Article 140 process, hosting multiple mediations and consultative sessions, including clarification of the electoral system citep:united_nations_report_2006-3, citep:united_nations_report_2007, citep:united_nations_report_2008-2. The June 5th 2007 UNAMI report specifically mentions the close working relationship between the Special Representative, UNAMI, the Government of Iraq, and other international organizations citep:united_nations_report_2007-1. UNAMI highlighted its direct involvement within the referendum negotiations, stating the &ldquo;intra-fractional violence&rdquo; within Kirkuk and Mosul citep:united_nations_report_2007-2.
However, the ultimate failure to implement Article 140 reflects on the success of UNAMI. UNAMI urged that the rising tensions following the failure to implement should be solved with national and local leaders working towards resolving the underlying disputed boundaries citep:united_nations_report_2009-1. However, tying the disputes to and sectarian identities to land boundaries fails to respect the sectarian identities at play, by treating the disputed boundaries as the source of the issues, rather than downstream to them. In the case of Kirkuk, even as the national level issues became deadlocked between Arab and Kurdish parties in parliament, local level politics became deadlocked for a different reason. Turkomen and Arab parties in the local council protested the 2006 decision to allow displaced Kurds to vote in the city council elections, and a rushed decision to conduct a census of Kirkuk within five months caused the collapse of the Article 140 committee . As the Article 140 deadline loomed, Shia and Sunni parties joined in to block the Kurdish bills in parliament, and the resumption of hostilities between Turkey and the PKK made the Kurdish maximalist position untenable, setting the stage for a mutual de-escalation of hostilities.
UNAMI engaged with the collapse of the Article 140 committee in two ways: by calling for national level reconciliation by settling land boundaries, and by engaging with local level politics in assuring the inclusion of minorities citep:united_nations_report_2008. While these measures were certainly welcome, they remained on the periphery and ignored why tensions had de-escalated. Kurdish supra-state sectarian identities had simultaneously manifested with the Sunni/Shia state-level sectarian identities had set the stage with the Kurdish offensive against Turkey. As the Kurdish Workers&rsquo; Party (PKK) restarted its offensive against Turkey, and Turkish airstrikes within Iraq in response caused a political crisis , citep:united_nations_report_2008 De-escalation had to occur outside the bounds of the Article 140 process, yet UNAMI continually pushed for reform and inclusion within the bounds.
The Article 140 case provides for a useful case study. On the surface, Article 140 addresses what is fundamentally a land dispute, which is the level that UNAMI engaged upon. The collapse of the Article 140 process and the tamping down of tensions with UNAMI&rsquo;s help appears to have been successful. When a sectarian framework is applied, however, a different picture emerges. When Sunnis and Shias crossed sectarian lines in order to vote against Kurdish parties in parliament, they asserted a state-level sectarian identity, that is, one that accepts the existence of the state of Iraq. Rather than asserting their own identities, the joint vote implies that Sunnis and Shias both did not believe in the reduction of the Iraqi state. In fact, a popular Shia poem laments that the Iraqi flag is not flown in the Kurdish lands , a clear statement that sectarian identities are not mutually exclusive with state level identities. When viewed from this angle, Article 140 becomes a referendum on an Iraqi identity vs a Kurdish one, and this was not a conceptual level UNAMI engaged upon.
In the opposite direction, the collapse of the process and its subsequent de-escalation of tensions was not due to UNAMI either. UNAMI continued to approach the problem as a land dispute, but the determining factor in the peace was the Kurdish over-extension of resources. In asserting a supra-state sectarian identity, the Kurdish maximalists were forced to come to the bargaining table with the Sunni and Shias.
Checklist Inclusion Outside of the Article 140 process, UNAMI&rsquo;s repeated engagements with minorities remained largely limited to ensuring minority representation among elections citep:united_nations_report_2008-2, such as helping to establish the Committee on Ethic and Religious Communities within Ninewa citep:united_nations_report_2010-1. The November 6th 2008 UNAMI report calls for &ldquo;Iraq’s diverse communities and their political leaders to continue to work with one another in a spirit of dialogue and grand compromise in a manner that reinforces the overall national interest&rdquo; citep:united_nations_report_2008-2.
This type of engagement leads to a form of &ldquo;checklist inclusion&rdquo;, wherein once certain parties are included within the political process, the substance of how these parties are included are ignored. In particular, power-sharing agreements can manifest as the continuation of conflict dynamics in the Lebanese case citep:delatolla_lebanese_2019, and can be seen in Iraq as well. No sectarian party within Iraq denies the existence of other groups, but all contest the grounds and power structures that arise from a pluralistic state. The incessant conspiracies about fake Shia demographics are a representation of this. Sunnis groups, when they boycotted the January 2005 elections, falsely assumed that Sunnis were a demographic majority citep:rayburn_iraq_2014. As recent as 2009, a Sunni political stated that the notion of a Sunni minority was a &ldquo;media lie&rdquo; .
This is where UNAMI falls short. Calls for national reconciliation and &ldquo;grand compromises&rdquo; will inevitably fail, because the sectarian groups do not even speak on the same conceptual level. UNAMI calls for a secular, pluralistic Iraq in which all parties are united at the state level, while the sectarian groups see the state as yet another battleground. As long as this conceptual gap exists, the calls for grand compromises will only lead to sectarian dynamics entrenched on the state level, as groups seek to assert their identities, and in so doing, &ldquo;deliberately discarded the institutions of the state, awarding different ministries to different political parties&rdquo; citep:dodge_beyond_2020.
To return to the March 2010 elections, the Erbil Agreement, which outlined the power sharing agreements for al-Maliki&rsquo;s government, was never released to the public. While the agreement itself formed a government of national unity, checking off all the requirements for a pluralistic government on the surface, the agreement effectively provided for zero oversight of the al-Maliki government. The Erbil Agreement shows that pluralistic governments can further entrench sectarian identities and dismember the rule of law.
The Missing Doctrine While some sectarian analysis overprivelage the doctrinal aspect, attempting to draw linkages between sect and ancient schisms in religion, the UNAMI reports seem to lurch in the other direction and pretend the doctrinal aspect does not exist at all. The UNAMI reports do not bring up the United Iraqi Alliance at all, also ignoring that Grand Ayatollah Sistani&rsquo;s blessing was one of the key reasons for the alliance&rsquo;s formation. The bombing of the al-Askari Shrine, an event which most scholars recognize as a key turning point in the formation of Iraqi sectarian identities , is recognized purely as an event that caused internal displacement peoples, without noting the religious markers around it citep:united_nations_report_2007,
Sectarian identities are often driven by a combination of religion and politics, with religion and politics existing in a feedback loop with one another, religious symbols can provide for legitimacy for political rulers, but religious minorities require the mechanisms of state for protection . However, this model only applies for governments with a functional oversight process. In the case of Iraq, the structural weaknesses of the state and the overtly Shia-leaning state nationalism helped to inflame sectarian tensions. The contestation over demographics is a proxy for the battle over the &ldquo;cultural ownership&rdquo; of Iraq . Images of mass graves are abundant Iraqi discourse, but in the south, mass graves are near-synonymous with the events of 1991 . Here, it is the mixing of a religious identity and trauma over past political events that creates for a particularly volatile cocktail that inflames sectarian tensions. As Kalvyas describes, &ldquo;it is the convergence between local motives and supralocal imperatives that endows civil war with its intimate character and leads to joint violence that straddles the divide between the political and the private, the collective and the individual&rdquo; .
UNAMI&rsquo;s reports, in ignoring the religious overtones of the 2005 elections and purely approaching the bombing from a humanitarian perspective ignores the &ldquo;normative ordering power&rdquo; of religion, which Brubaker describes as a understanding of what is right and what is wrong, beyond the level of individual behavior citep:brubaker_religious_2015. Ignoring the doctrinal aspect fails to understand the greater issues of society as a whole. When UNAMI fails to report the doctrinal and religious overtones, a key component is missing in the analysis of violence within civil war.
Conclusion The UNAMI reports from 2003 to 2010 note the rise of sectarian identities within Iraq, trending towards the entrenchment of the muhasa ta&rsquo;ifia. UNAMI&rsquo;s engagement with the violent manifestations of these identities were on multiple axes: calling for unity and reconciliation, linking reconciliation to the peaceful settlement of land boundaries, and ensuring the representation of minority communities within electoral systems. On the surface, these seem largely successful, successful elections have been held, the constitutional time bomb of Article 140 did not trigger another bout of civil war, and minority communities had access to parliamentary systems.
However, the failures of UNAMI are laid bare when applying a deeper model of sectarian identities. When sectarian identities are understood as having the four consitutant sides of substate, state, supra-state, and doctrinal levels, the UNAMI portrait becomes less rosy. The calls for unity and reconciliation began to look like securitization, demonizing and shutting out non-sectarian parties from parliamentary representation, as the government became more and more sectarian. Defusing the time bomb of Article 140 was not due to UNAMI, but rather a confluence of circumstances. Checklist style engagement on the national level, without being aware of how parties engage with each other leads to further entrenchment of identities.

Working Title: UNAMI&rsquo;s Stumble into Sectarian Narratives Main Research Questions and Arguments Research Question: Have the mandates for UNAMI substantively shifted to counteract sectarian identities in Iraq, or have they supported these identities in a form of &ldquo;liddism&rdquo;? Argument: The perspective of international human rights promulgated by the UN is inherently a western-liberal one that favors states, because of UNAMI&rsquo;s position, it has inherently favored Iraq&rsquo;s drift towards an unwritten sectarian government (muhasasa ta’ifia) in its pursuit of mandates. Theoretical Framework and Research Method This project will be approached from a post-structuralist perspective. The resulting muhasasa system of Iraq is seen as a result of elite actors (UNAMI, US, elite Iraqis).
The research method will be to trace the discourse of the UN through its various resolutions relating to Iraq in understanding how it has evolved over time and in relation to major political events in Iraq.
Organization and Substantive Components Introduction, Background The introduction focuses on the role and limited mandate of UNAMI The background focuses on the construction of the 2003 Iraqi government and the formation of the 2005 constitution, both of which were sectarian in nature. Discussions on UNAMI Discuss how UNAMI mandates have shifted with each major political event. For each event, evaluate the sectarian markers, such as debates over the rights of Christian minorities, the Kirkuk problem, and how UNAMI mandates have responded to them.

https://tech.slashdot.org/story/20/12/14/2124229/heres-the-5g-glossary-every-american-is-apparently-going-to-need T-Mobile last week introduced the market&rsquo;s newest 5G moniker: &ldquo;Ultra Capacity.&rdquo; The label, writes blog LightReading, will stew alongside &ldquo;5G Ultra Wideband,&rdquo; &ldquo;Extended Range 5G,&rdquo; &ldquo;5G+,&rdquo; &ldquo;5Ge,&rdquo; &ldquo;5GTF,&rdquo; &ldquo;5G Nationwide&rdquo; and plain-old &ldquo;5G&rdquo; in the US wireless industry, ensuring that if American mobile customers aren&rsquo;t confused yet, it&rsquo;s only a matter of time before they&rsquo;re hopelessly bewildered by operators&rsquo; thesaurus-toting marketing executives. So here&rsquo;s that 5G lexicon everyone is apparently going to need, the blog reports:
5G Ultra Capacity: This is the new brand that T-Mobile is applying to its 5G network running in the midband 2.5GHz spectrum it acquired from Sprint, as well as its highband, millimeter wave (mmWave) spectrum. The operator said customers with &ldquo;5G Ultra Capacity&rdquo; phones and coverage can expect speeds around 300 Mbit/s up to peaks of 1 Gbit/s.
5G Ultra Wideband: This is the label Verizon has applied to its 5G network running in its own mmWave spectrum. Due to the physics of signal propagation in such spectrum, mmWave transmitters can&rsquo;t reach receivers that are more than a few thousand feet away.
5G+: This is the label AT&amp;T has applied to its own mmWave network. However, the operator appears to be focusing its energies on 5G in other spectrum bands.
Extended Range 5G: This is the label T-Mobile has given to its 5G network in its lowband 600MHz spectrum, which supports slower speeds than mmWave or midband networks. As you can imagine, given the name, signals in Extended Range 5G go much, much further than signals in mmWave spectrum, again due to the physics of signal propagation in lowband spectrum like 600MHz. Verizon and AT&amp;T also operate extensive lowband 5G networks.
5G Nationwide: This is the label Verizon has applied to its lowband 5G network. It&rsquo;s similar to T-Mobile&rsquo;s &ldquo;Extended Range 5G,&rdquo; although T-Mobile has dedicated some 600MHz spectrum to 5G while Verizon is using a technology called Dynamic Spectrum Sharing (DSS) to put both 4G and 5G signals in its lowband spectrum.
5Ge: This is the moniker AT&amp;T gave to its 4G LTE network in 2018, sparking plenty of controversy. The action allowed AT&amp;T to quickly offer 5G icons to most of its customers without actually having to deploy a 5G network that adheres to the 3GPP&rsquo;s official 5G technology standard.
5GTF: This is the technology label that Verizon tacitly applied to its initial 5G Home fixed wireless service running in its mmWave spectrum. The network initially did not work on the official 3GPP 5G technology standard and instead worked on a derivation developed by Verizon and its vendors. However, Verizon has since shifted its 5G Home service to the official 3GPP 5G standard.
5G: This is the catch-all label that operators are applying to whatever their marketing teams haven&rsquo;t gotten their fingers on yet. T-Mobile used &ldquo;5G&rdquo; for a while until it introduced &ldquo;Ultra Capacity,&rdquo; and AT&amp;T still uses &ldquo;5G&rdquo; for its lowband 5G network.

I want to add two interrelated concepts to the pile of actor-network theory readings we had this week: the concept of &ldquo;memory&rdquo; and emergent behavior. For memory, I refer to particular path dependence, that for a particular actor to transition from one state to another requires memory of the previous state. A spring, for example, springs back based on the memory of how much it was pressed down (to a physical maximum). Ice must transition into a liquid state before becoming water vapor, in essence, &ldquo;remembering&rdquo; that it has to become water before it becomes vapor. Emergent behavior is the claim that particular behavior occurs once a network achieves a certain quality: the connections between actors can be unidirectional or bidirectional, actors can have a large number of connections, making the network very dense, or a small number of connections, make the networks very sparse, and even the size of the connections can matter. Single celled organisms are significantly less agentive than multicelled ones, even though the quality of cells does not vary significantly.
The reason for these abstractions on top of ANT is that I think an agency can be sufficiently modeled with these two concepts. The agency of an actor can be modeled as a function of their memory, and/or their network density.
Paper, as described by the Hull reading, provides a good example. As Hull shows, the material nature of bureaucracy is embodied within files. Files originally start as a particular form of memory: if we are to imagine this in the concept of ANT, the person is a single node, and the files can be represented as another node, with a low bandwidth bidirectional link between them. Bidirectional represents a person adding and retrieving files, and low bandwidth represents that the person does not do it very frequently, a thin &ldquo;pipe&rdquo; of information. However, as files grow and the pace of addition and retrieval increases, the pipe must increase in size to accommodate more frequent retrieval of files, and the connection grows thicker in size. At a certain point, a singular person cannot manage to add and retrieve the necessary amount of files at the same time, necessitating another person. Instead of person &lt;&ndash;&gt; files, the network has expanded to person &lt;&ndash;&gt; files &lt;&ndash;&gt; person. As this process continues, we find a particular emergence occurring: rather than a network centered on the original person, who has created the files, we find that the center of the network has become the files themselves, a behavior that is &ldquo;emergent&rdquo;. Additionally, due to the fact that the files hold literal memory, the files gain more agency within the network. Access and signatures develop a particular semiotic, files no longer influence the person they are directly connected to, but to the second order of connections. What begins as a form of categorization has become constitutive of the political economy that Hull describes, and the demon of writing that Ben Kafka describes.

This took the form of isolated memory, CPU&rsquo;s use memory management by limiting page access to specific processess, and privilege levels that prevent untrusted code from manipulating the page access code, this is related to TLBs, which make the overhead far too expensive

What questions are being asked?
How do we concieve of jursiprudence? How are sharia law and fiqh used to mediate between the state and the masses? Is the current viewing of shariah as a condified set of rules a direct desendant of colonial times? Are modern state law and shariah law incompatible? Was the encoding of sharia into strict Western jurisprudence a product of colonial practices, or of modernity? Or both? Methodologies being used
Not totally sure on this one, this article largely seems to be a historical understanding of how sharia law was developed Central concepts and assumptions
Sharia law and fiqh were considered as two different things Sharia as divine, fiqh as human reasoning Islamic law is &ldquo;bottom up&rdquo;, derived from communities and norms Muslim jurists recongized the potential issues of a pure textual approach and advocated for different forms of reasoning, so long as the jurist exerted proper effort and due diligence. Connections and contrasts with other readings
With Hart&rsquo;s theory of law
interesting that the reading addresses austin&rsquo;s theory of law but does not address hart&rsquo;s theory of law hart considers the law as conferring powers and imposing duties, such as the problems of duty imposing laws and continuity of laws is Islamic &ldquo;law&rdquo; more closer to how Hart perceives it? Hart actually assumes a pre-legal society where &ldquo;laws&rdquo; are social customs, diving into the problem of uncertainty and problem of stasis hart&rsquo;s rule of change and rule of adjudication rule of change -&gt; confers authority and positions to change the rules al-Fadl talks about the difference between sharia and fiqh sharia confers authority only to god fiqh confers authority to jurists rule of adjucation -&gt; distinguishes which rules are which already stated as above With Sartori, Paolo. “Between Kazan and Kashghar: On the Vernacularization of Islamic Jurisprudence in Central Eurasia.” Die Welt Des Islams, August 28, 2020, 1–31. https://doi.org/10.1163/15700607-00600A18.
al-Fadl places emphasis on the debasement of sharia with the arrival of colonial powers and codification of sharia into law
Sartori points out that there inherently was an indigenous debasement of sharia outside of the Islamic heartland, rulings and texts had to be translated, which leads to an inherent elevation of specific texts
Glasserman asks what does sharia look like in the classroom vs in the courtroom
if we buy al-Fadl&rsquo;s understanding the sharia is embodied in communities and fiqh can be seen as temporal, what does fiqh look like when it&rsquo;s mediating the mundane? What does fiqh look like in Medina vs Khorosan? al-Fadl points out the distinguishment of specific schools and gives some background to how they arose, but also fails to consider the process of langauge, Arabic in many places was already considered to be a cosmopolitan language
al-Fadl&rsquo;s tension is between sharia and the modern state. What about the tension between sharia and education? Sharia must be encoded somehow, is there always going to be a hierarchy (either indigenous or foreign)? Can we separate sharia from the process of language itself?
With Li, Darryl. The Universal Enemy: Jihad, Empire, and the Challenge of Solidarity. Stanford Studies in Middle Eastern and Islamic Societies and Cultures. Stanford, California: Stanford University Press, 2020.
Li points out the forms of more &ldquo;up to date&rdquo; readings of Islamic understanding in the context of the Bosnian jihad, such as The Sealed Nectar. This is a potential example of more contemporary forms of revivalism that goes beyond the state (the jihad arguably occured outside the traditional realms of the modern nation-state), which might point at an answer to al-Fadl&rsquo;s question. Li also points out how The Sealed Nectar was undeniabily Salafi, but also recieved without controversy in Bosnia. He also points out how the book was exceptionally well-researched compared to its peers.

Notes - sharia law as not a &ldquo;law&rdquo; but as a result of islamic normativity
sharia as a practised disipline of deliverative and purposeful practical reasoning
reduction of sharia through western eyes, codification of sharia actually reduces
cannot disembody sharia law from the norms that constructed it codifciation of sharia in terms of western jurisprudence is like a phantom limb, feeling something that isn&rsquo;t there codification of the divine poses two main questions: is modern state law, focused on centralized burecratic control, the &lsquo;ruin&rsquo; of Islamic law? and can Islamic law exist in the modern age outside the state?
is islamic law doomed to be passed down from the state? what is the nature and purpose of Islamic law?
Islamic jurisprudencial theory talks about the complexity of the divine does not fault jurists for arriving at wrong conclusions, so long as they make an attempt Islamic law is &ldquo;bottom up&rdquo;, derived from communities and norms
Western law is &ldquo;top down&rdquo;, derived from a centralized state
interesting that the reading addresses austin&rsquo;s theory of law but does not address hart&rsquo;s theory of law hart considers the law as conferring powers and imposing duties, such as the problems of duty imposing laws and continuity of laws is Islamic &ldquo;law&rdquo; more closer to how Hart perceives it? Hart actually assumes a pre-legal society where &ldquo;laws&rdquo; are social customs, diving into the problem of uncertainty and problem of stasis hart&rsquo;s rule of change and rule of adjudication rule of change -&gt; confers authority and positions to change the rules al-Fadl talks about the difference between sharia and fiqh sharia confers authority only to god fiqh confers authority to jurists rule of adjucation -&gt; distinguishes which rules are which already stated as above foundations of Islamic jurisprudence:
Qur&rsquo;an Sunnah qiyas (analytical reasoning)/reason for shi&rsquo;i&rsquo;s ijma (juridical consensus) notes that many jursists already recongized that the authenticity of the qur&rsquo;an was divine, but the practices of the prophet were not always the most accurate
Pluralism of islamic law
early schools proliferated and had to walk a fine line between upsetting the state and mediating between the masses and the state al-Juwayni recongized that there was no correct answer in legal questions, but there were best answers
as long as jursists exerted effort and due diligence, the resulting determination held legitimancy
sharia is the divine, ffqh is recongized only to be potentially so
very few parts of sharia that were exempty from human inquiry
During the age of proliferation, one does notice the incredibly broad expanse of space which came under the legitimate jurisdiction of fiqh. Put differently, there did not seem to be many issues in the shari&rsquo;ah that were off limits for the inquiries of fiqh
sharia seeks to promote 5 principals
life intellect reputation or dignity lineage or family property four sunni schools
hanafi maliki al-shafi&rsquo;i hanbali three shia schools
ja&rsquo;fari zaydi ismaili also talks about islamic revivalism, and how that lead to the codification of shariah in the contemporary age
difference between ibadat and mu&rsquo;amalat
ibadat deals with matters of ritual and worship favors textualism and originalism mu&rsquo;amalat regulates human relationships favors creativity and reasoning possible to specialize in either ibadat or mu&rsquo;amalat without doing the other
considerable debate under what is considered ibadat or mu&rsquo;amlat
zina (fornication or adultery) or alcohol consumption, for example fiqh is contextual and temporal
abu hamid al-ghazali jursists agreed that humans cannot benefit or harm god, so unlike the rights owed to human beings, the rights of god do not involve any actual interests of god
leading to ideas about how huquq al-ibad (rights of god) does not refer to public or common rights, but the material interests and benefits of all mankin god does not need to empower an agent, humans do how does this relate to the Saddam Mosque in Hilla?

Beyond the basic understanding of Algerian law from the French as a single source that displaces and breaks family and tribal lands, this is the molding of the Algerian body into prostitution. Paceman tells us about the sexual differences and how the public is the domain of the masculine while the private is the domain of the feminine, and a key portion is that men are allowed to cross by way of property.
But it&rsquo;s not just property that allows for men to cross, we can turn the feminine into property as well (although this is usually seen as bad). The norm is that the orientalist fantasies of Algeria was constituted by the French talking over the feminine, but to draw the body into property is what is fascinating here. how does Algeria constitute the part of the woman?

I recently read an article by Patrick Wyman on how empires in decline have their wars reverberate back on them. The gist of it: empires typically have their domestic affairs shielded away from their foreign actions. It&rsquo;s only when empires are in decline that you see the actions in foreign lands affect things back home. In the case of the US, the failed wars of Iraq and Afghanistan contribute to the militarization of the police and erosion of the rights of domestic citizens, such as the case of Portland and federal paramilitary snatching up protestors.
I agree with Wyman, since 2001, under the arching theme of &ldquo;never again&rdquo;, American institutions have become more defensive and more brutal1, becoming what Bruno Macaes calls a &ldquo;citadel on a hill&rdquo;. However, I want to push Wyman&rsquo;s idea further: recent events, such as the paramilitaries in Portland, the alt-right militias, and even the protests can be traced back to America&rsquo;s foundational culture, the concept of settler colonialism in the &ldquo;frontier lands&rdquo; of Westward expansion. Settler colonialism is alive and well in the US, the failures in Iraq and Afghanistan just make them more clear.
Settler colonialism isn&rsquo;t like the typical British/India colonialism, where you have one ruling group (i.e. the British) dominating another group (the Indians). Rather, settler colonialism is about replacing the indigenous population, and taking over their lands. This is deeply rooted in American society, it&rsquo;s the foundation to why certain Americans perceive themselves as &ldquo;real&rdquo; Americans. These people largely buy into the concept of a &ldquo;coastal elite&rdquo;, typically hold blue-collar jobs, and likely live in racially/culturally homogenous areas2. While there are exceptions, the point is this: there is a group of Americans who perceive themselves as a more legitimate heir to a certain American society than others.
This ideology can be traced back to settler colonialism. Settler colonialism in America allowed for western settlers in the 1800&rsquo;s to buy into this idea of a &ldquo;blank slate&rdquo;, a tabula rasa where one can manifest their destiny. The &ldquo;West&rdquo; was blank, a boundless resource to be exploited. This conveniently sets aside the brutality inflicted on the Native Americans, who had to be forcefully removed from their land in order to create this blank slate.
In conjuction to the the concept of a frontier, the American South exploited its resources through the insitution of slavery. Slavery, at it&rsquo;s core, disposesses people of the fruits of their labor. Slavery takes away the results of what you do in exchange for nothing. Slavery was how the south built its economy, in contrast to the undeveloped west. The question then becomes: why did the US never enslave Native Americans on a mass level? The colonalization of the Midwest plains began in the late 1820&rsquo;s, slavery was not formally abolished until 1865. Enslaving Native Americans would have been a far cheaper source of labor than black slaves, so why was there never any formal institution set up to enslave Native Americans?
The answer is that black slaves had no collective claims to the land they worked on. Black slaves, stripped of their heritage and past, could not have any claim that they had settled on the land they worked on, while Native Americans had lived on their lands for generations. These are the twin engines of American settler colonialism, taking away land from the Native Americans, taking away the products of labor from black slaves. Also in the 1800&rsquo;s, David Ricardo formulated the idea of land and its relationship to economics, and Marx linked the idea of labor and economics. Westward expansion was, above all, an economic project, and it found its base in two populations: Ricardo for the Native American, Marx for the black slave.
It is in this bubble that the first concept of a &ldquo;real&rdquo; American begins to form. The frontiersman of westward expansion were only able to expand out onto the pristine plains by driving out the native populations, fueled with tools and wealth generated through slavery. The frontiersman could hold up an image of &ldquo;self-made&rdquo;, man against nature, even though the conditions that allowed manifest destiny were created through immense suffering of the Native Americans and black slaves.
The American society of the post-World War II era was formed in much of the same way. In the era of the American empire expanding overseas after World War II, Americans found themselves in a similar situation, they could claim to live in a meritocracy where all you had to do was work hard, even though this was based on the suffering of people all over the world. The twin engines that powered America&rsquo;s economy, Native Americans and black slaves, had been replaced with consumers overseas. In the wake of the Cold War, America&rsquo;s manufacturing and export economy required a healthy consumer base, and the only way to achieve that was to corner the global market. Thus the Cold War began, alongside the propping up of brutal dictators to fight against communism. Native peoples in South Vietnam, Chile, and the other countries where the US fought proxy wars or supported brutal regimes did not die for &ldquo;freedom&rdquo; or &ldquo;halting of Communist expansion&rdquo;, they died so that the US could maintain countries to export to. Ultimately, Americans in the Cold War could tell themselves American society was fair and equal, even as the conditions for a &ldquo;fair and equal&rdquo; American society was on the backs of millions overseas.
Back to modern day America. Modern day America is reeling from its failures in Iraq and Afghanistan, yet why did the same thing not happen in the wake of the Vietnam war? How did America disengage from Vietnam with, as George Kennan phrased it, &ldquo;total withdrawal, followed by silence and detachment&rdquo;3?
The answer is television, and by extension, social media. The first war that was made-for-TV was the first Gulf War. Broadcasted on television, the US&rsquo;s quick destruction of Iraqi army in Kuwait shocked the world with American power. Technical superiority, there for all to see. This led to a revival in how other perceive American strength, no longer was America the country that lost a war to South Asian farmers, it was the country with vast technical support that could demolish an army within days, and America was ready to show everyone. The fall of the Soviet Union, only ten months after the end of the first Gulf War, made American society, culture, and military seem all the more indomitable. Television linked together American society, culture, and military and bound together the success of America militarily with the success of American culture. You could root for your fellow countrymen from the safety of your couch.
It is this reviere that Iraq and Afghanistan shake us out of. No matter the technical superiority, the US military was unable to establish a functioning democracy in Iraq, and barely able to rebuild society in Afghanistan. After nearly two decades of war, the American spell has thoroughly been broken, its failures laid bare for every citizen to see, share, like and subscribe. If TV linked together American culture and the military, social media threatens to break it apart4.
This is how imperial wars come home. Failed imperial wars do not come home by only bringing their guns and training back back5, they come back by shaking us out of our fugues. The failures of Iraq and Afghanistan prompt Americans to do soul-searching of their society, and what they see now is a society marred by rising inequality, leaders asleep at the wheel, and unresolved racism. American society is deeply adept at amnesia, no true transitional justice has ever been held for Native Americans, and the racial wealth gap between blacks and whites in the US should be self-explanatory. This leads to the rise of &ldquo;bro&rdquo; culture, a culture where one can escape to a world that seems more meritocratic than the America of today, while talking about how America was already great. It leads to the alt-right militias, who are far more devoted to their anti-authority ideology than their racism6. The alt-right militias fight for an America of the past, an America whose sins can be glossed over, atrocities that can be followed by &ldquo;silence and detachment&rdquo;. Imperial wars come home by bringing more than the toys of war or their scarred soldiers, imperial wars have come by laying bare the indecent form of the American frontier.
Children in cages. Enough said.&#160;&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;
Such as the Midwest.&#160;&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;
Macaes, History Has Begun, Page 161&#160;&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;
This is why the military is so bipartisan, the military is deeply attached to the American empire, and the continuation of the American empire is one thing both parties are keen on.&#160;&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;
Although the surplus weaponry transfers from the Pentagon and the veterans to police pipeline is definitely worthy of further study.&#160;&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;
The current militias such as the Boogaloo boys see the current establishment moving towards systems of transitional justice. It&rsquo;s not that they are inherently racist or white supremist (although many of them certainly are), it&rsquo;s that they see attempts at transitional justice as signs that their reality is inherently wrong. Their entire identity is premised on this idea of being self-made, that everyone is equal. When the inequities are exposed, we get the anti-authority militias.&#160;&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;

Outline Archive intro Brief paragraph on each one of the people and themes Themes
What gets lost? Who chooses what is recorded? How is an archive organized? Archives in the modern age Shawky
Queer voices -&gt; who is left in an out of an archive Actual The archive is one of the most seductive objects within our modern world. Originally referring to a location where government records are stored, the emergence of the digital archive, as well as access to archives within the digital space, has pushed the bounaries on what an archive is. The allure of the archive has given birth to what Derrida calls &ldquo;Archive Fever&rdquo; &ndash; a mad rush by academics to read both with and against the grain of archives.
In the shadow of academic archive fever, the digital space has produced an analgue: rather than reconstructing the logic for government archives, every person is constructing their own archive. Whether through photos or messages, we have become sentries of our own knowledge and experiences, and in sharing portions of our own archives with one another, we allow each other to engage in archive fever.
With this lens, we analyzed the Digital Forays event held on October 15th with Asunción Molinos Gordo, Mohammad Shawky Hassan, and Diana Allan, moderated by Helga Tawil-Souri. The panel touched on a variety of topics throughout their three projects: the living archive with Asuncion, reenactment of the past to incorporate lost narratives with Shawky, and the transformation of a classical archive into a digital one via video with Allan.
The panel ultimately focuses around a renewed understanding of what the archive is, and the ways in which an archive is problematic. We understood this to be three main topics: the accessibility of an archive, the scope of an archive, and the temporality of an archive.
The accessibility of an archive is one of the more classical archive questions. In answering the questions: who is allowed to see an archive, and what the archive is meant for, we can begin to see the contours of how an archive breaks down. Archives meant for a specific purpose can be challenged and be read in a very different way, and by understanding the logic of how the archive was constructed in the first place, we can begin to break down the archive into its constituiant parts. Diana recreated an archive of refugee experiences, and in so doing, very specifically chose to speak against British propaganda. Although her source material was pulled from a state archive that was geared towards a specific purpose, alteration to the films allows us to view these experiences in a new light.
The scope of an archive, like the accessibility of an archive, is another classical archive question. The questions of &ldquo;what is worthy of storing in an archive&rdquo; has plagued scholars for centuries. Not only does this question affect the items that go into an archive, it affects which items may be stored alongside the items, and how items are arranged within an archive. In the wake of the French Revolution, which spearheaded the development of the archival science and &ldquo;included the conceptualization of the public status of and the stat&rsquo;s responsibilitiers to guard both the nation&rsquo;s heritage&rdquo; (DiCapua, 100), two principals were established: the relience on provenance and the respect for the primitive order. The reliance on provenance assumes that records have orginated from purposeful organized activity, and that records should be kept within the same order they arrived, allowing them to be reviewed in their totality (this point was repliacted by Zaatari). Respect for the primitive order states that documents should not be reordered, understanding that each series was constructed with reason, and the series order itself is a document. These two principals, in conjunction with the pure decision on what kinds of items go into an archive, means that many voices are left out of archives completely, either based on pure chance or deliberate elision. Shawky&rsquo;s work addressed these points: by recreating classical works and music through queer narratives, he has preserved the series of classical records, in line with archival principals, but also deliberately added the narratives that had been elided out.

Review/Response Talal Asad is deeply concerned about the concept of friendship in this book, and steps through an linguistic analogy of untranslatability, followed by a numerical one about the state using numbers, and ending with a statement about amr bil maruf. In the classical Asad&rsquo;ian way, the point comes across through a variety of writers and sources, drawing from Jakobson to Gilgamesh to Arendt and a gaggle of other characters.
There&rsquo;s a few notions that I want to pick out, one of which is Asad&rsquo;s idea of untranslatability. He cites Jakobson (I actually laughed out loud when Asad first brought up Jakobson, Jakobson in linguistics is regarded as a great thinker, but incredibly inscrutable) without bringing up Jakobson concept of the cube, which Jakobson describes in &ldquo;Morphological Observations on Slavic Declensions.&rdquo; The cube, as Jakobson describes, is a 3d system of the Russian declension, where a fixed set of transformations allows a noun to shift its meaning, but more importantly, there is a fixed algorithm, certain declensions can only be arrived at from certain departures. For example, certain morphological structures only work in concert with other shared structures, an English example would be that we can rearrange &ldquo;a house was there&rdquo; to &ldquo;there was a house&rdquo;, but when incorporating what the linguists call a &ldquo;wh&rdquo; word, &ldquo;where is a house?&rdquo; cannot be rearranged into &ldquo;a house was where?&rdquo; and maintain the same acceptability to a listener. Jakobson&rsquo;s work was among the early linguistic work after Chomsky to identify that meaning lies beyond just words, syntax plays a role as well. Other linguists have followed this up to show that phonological structures and morphological structures, syntax and pragmatics, all play a role in how we conceptualize &ldquo;meaning&rdquo;.
Asad takes this metaphor and applies it to liberalism/secularism. He does mix the usage of &ldquo;language&rdquo; and &ldquo;words&rdquo; at various points, such as &ldquo;it is not the Arabic language that is sacred but the enunciation of divine virtues&rdquo; (60), which is a slippage most linguists would be wary of. The translation of religion to secularism, for example, while maintaining roughly the same structures that have existed in the past, and while we can fully keep in mind that the notion of secularity we have arrived at is born from, and nearly inseparable from its Protestant past, Asad tells us that there exist areas which remain untranslatable. He talks about how secularism, in being defined from the negative of religion, cannot do without religion, and actually certain aspects of religion remain outside the realm of translatability for secularism. He further goes onto say that, with this fully in mind, secularism has sought to justify itself via numbers, a tool that allows for the secular state to achieve greater heights of legibility, and allow it to formalize the contract it has made with its subjects, in regards to the secularity, stability, and promises of life. He tells us that the secular state, via numbers and the concept of efficiency, already has the &ldquo;moral language available to the state to justify its representation of the nation&rdquo; (115).
Given that this is our last class, this book gave me very mixed feelings about the questions that we have raised. We have discussed how secularization theory does not hold water, how religious actors have repeatedly invited the adjudication of state, how secularism is a political settlement of religious and political actors, and how secularity is intertwined with the idea of religion. From the courtroom to notions of veils, our secular views are inheritors of a regime left by the Protestants, and how some religious actors especially made themselves legible to the new political regimes. In an Asad&rsquo;ian fashion, I will make a loosely related analogy and arrive at a point later:
One of the first problems (or some variation) given to a first year student in probability is this:
&ldquo;A drunken sailor stands near the edge of an abyss and takes random steps either towards or away from the edge. A step towards the edge has a probability of ppp and a step away from the edge has a probability of (1−p)(1 - p)(1−p). If the sailor starts nnn steps from the edge, what is his chance of survival? What is the minimum value of ppp for which there is no chance of survival?&rdquo; (https://twitter.com/bilayerguy/status/1098926919402311680)
This problem is useful to illustrate to students that the end result, despite being a probabilistic process, is that if something lives, then the longer it is expected to live (aka the Lindy effect). In the same problem, if mathematically simulated 10,000 times, if the sailor has lived past 1,000 steps, the expected survival rate goes from 7.7% to 30%.
In relation to religion, this tells us that, although we constantly reproduce symbols, and although symbols are reinterpreted in a myriad of ways, religious practices that have long lived may continue to survive. On the other hand, the sailor dies in the majority unless he survives past 5000 steps, which suggests that there may remain potential for radical change.
Asad ends with a line about friendship, and almost lamenting the loss of mutuality in the modern world. Lacking amr bil maruf, we exist in a world governed by numbers, and the self-disciplined logics of the state deems that those who do not board the energy-efficient capitalistic ark are barbarians who will be left behind. Asad does not bring this up, but the rise in protests all across the world since 2008, and in fact the protests of the last two years have brought up the idea of &ldquo;confusion&rdquo; and &ldquo;ungovernability&rdquo; (https://endnotes.org.uk/file_hosting/Onward_Barbarians_by_Endnotes.pdf). Confusion because people are now choosing to organize along lines not previously recognized by the political settlement that is secularity, and ungovernability because they subscribe to a different universalism. Darry Li has written about how the universalism of foreign fighters during the Bosian jihad bumps against the universalism of the liberal borders. In the end, I take a different tact than Asad, that the concepts of mutuality and friendship are not lost, but rather just like religious symbols, are constantly being reproduced.

Do IO&rsquo;s freeze existing configurations of power? Do IO&rsquo;s pluralize power IO&rsquo;s are defenders and agents of reform, with the ability to provide compulsory powers and insitutional powers
Compulsory powers: taking direct action, such as un peacekeeping, naming and shaming, etc
Insitutional powers: setting the agenda, declaring people persona non-grata, classifiation

Why do states create IO&rsquo;s?
Stabilize international and political agreements (&ldquo;freezing&rdquo; of power) To enhance coordination between states The most powerful part of an IO is it&rsquo;s legitimacy, and it&rsquo;s ability to determine who gets a seat at the table

As the power of individual states fade on the global stage, does that mean our goals are similariy less defined? &ldquo;Occupy&rdquo; Draws links to the occupy movement &ldquo;Almost all expressed dissent against the effects of neoliberal policies, notably staggering inequality, unemployment, precarious work, and uncertain life that had gripped a large segment of ordinary citizens&rdquo; - pg 13 &ldquo;Sociologists Manuel Castells and Sideny Tarrow suggest that the achievement of the Occupy movements was their very operation.

Massive looting, but less structural reform? Was that because many of the governements knew what to do? &ldquo;The protests of 2011, however, were neither for revolution nor for reform; rather, they expressed a rebellion against the insitutions of representative democracy without offering any alternative&rdquo; - pg 17 What baggage does this claim bring?

Force does not solve all problems, and force and peacekeeping are two different things We must understand that this means peacekeeping is only one part of it force only works in conjunction with the political ends, much like counterterrorism Simpson - War from the Ground Up &ldquo;For all its finely balanced and properly justified criticism of UN actions in Bosnia, that conclusion was also at the heart of the Srebrenica Report issued in 1999: &ldquo;peacekeeping and war fighting are distinct activities and should not be mixed&rdquo; (UN 1999a, 107). An inescapable corollary of this is that there will also be circumstances when the instrument of peacekeeping is not appropriate. The history of UN operations over the past decade and a half does not fundamentally alter these lessons.&rdquo; (Berdal 2019:125)
deteorating UN conditions where peacekeepers operate have laid bare the problems of UN dysfunction use of force limitations has bad applications for state soveriengty host govs can be uncooperative, even spoilers as the UN sets up shop political status often gets complicated by the arrival of peacekeepers disputants need to be carved out `}),e.add({id:187,href:"/posts/bert/",title:"bert",content:`Tags: nlp

Talks about how collective punishment is meted out by the Saddam regime. Primary thesis concerns the legibility of citizenry, the more &ldquo;legible&rdquo; the citizenry is to the regime, the more targeted punishments become.
Homogenous socities with dictators spawn low trust because the society is relatively easy to be infiltrated.
Collective punishment heightens group identities, such as the case of:

Refugees and history are a two way street, internal refugees of the Ottoman empire are seen as chess pieces when in fact they shape policy. The book attemps to bring Balkan refugees, Albania, Anatolia, and Mandata Iraq and Syria in the same style as Anscombe - State, Faith, and Nation, enlarging the frame of the &ldquo;post-Ottoman&rdquo;. Also pulls in the domination of international finance and capitalism as a centripedal force.
The refugee is, in other words, a monolith, a categorical point of reference made subordinate to a larger narrative about the trajectory of the empire and its successor ethno-national states. - pg 3 Refugees are invoked to reinforce the myths of the modern state&rsquo;s inevitability rather thana way to understand complex social and economic changes surrounding their experience. Ideas about a &ldquo;historically inevitable&rdquo; violent collapse of the premodern multiethnic empire presupposes the nation shedding a &ldquo;backward&rdquo; or &ldquo;Oriental&rdquo; past by becoming an ethnostate. Refugees often became armed militias, social clubs, viable constituencies demanding institutional attention. Finance Capitalism tanzimat reforms introduced the financial reforms that opened up the Ottoman empire during the Crimean war retrograde Hamidian era did not attempt to reform this large amounts of Ottoman debt Emergent financial cartel of Europe wanted their hands on the Ottoman empire Infrastructure projects gave European bank cartels cover for finance capitalism Provisional Modernity in the Western Balkans Argues against the cultural identity as a sole factor Demands the refugges put on host communities disrupted or even outright destroyed indigenous political structures - pg 47 Refugees dispaced as part of the resetllement regime formed interest groups that worked their way into local affairs Kosovo and Albania (mostly autonomous) reached out to the Ottoman government to request state assistance in the mobilized and hostile refugee communities Serbia state bureaucracies became political battlegrounds, and due to inheriting debt from the Ottoman empire, required opening their economies to European private capital Hasa drought of 1890 chased out large group of people and drove them towards basra Romania, Bulgaria, and Egypt Both less hostile to integrating the dynamic Ottoman refugees Drita - famous social club in Bucharest that communicated to the larger Ottoman diaspora via a Osmanli (CUP publication in Geneva) School textbooks seemed to fit Anderson - Imagined Communities, but Drita denies this because every one of their publications was inspired by beyond ethno-linguistic lines alone Opponents also felt it was necessary to publically challenge Drita If ethno-linguistic lines hold, neither of these would&rsquo;ve been needed, but rather the &ldquo;market share&rdquo; of Dirta was what was important egypt had developed a panoply of modern-looking, ethno-national, or sectarian oriented communities via European patrons Transnational Migrants Connection of global finance allowed Arab workers to go as far as Indochina and the Philippines Criminalizing of indigenous trade opened up international middle men Baghdadi Jews occupied a wealthy entrepreneur class of tea traders Treaty of Naking British envisioned supplanting all competiting interests within the Middle East by the cultivation of Hadhrami families &lsquo;Alawi and Nakshabandi families of Sufi Hadhriami were linked to a network of commerce and spirituality, similar to Can - Spiritual Subjects Missionaries at the Imperial Idealogical Edge Erection of schools, madrasas, and mosques in the 1850&rsquo;s are typically seen as emblematic of proactive Ottman state trying to harness Islam But also argued that regardless of actual need, the determination of these resources were allocated based on the strength of the regional representation within the halls of power I will ultimately conclude that there is no identifiable pattern to how different Muslims interact with the world. - pg 116 Can - Spiritual Subjects describes sufi orders in the Hamidian era, could we consider these people an Anderson - Imagined Communities? In order to centralize state power, Ottoman governoners like in the Shkoder mountains formed organizations like the &ldquo;Committee of the Shkoder Mountains&rdquo; and given formal titles and salaries Shared negotiations like in Meeker - A Nation of Empire Ottoman Internationalism &lsquo;Alawiyya missionaries in the Hijaz sought to convert people and trade in East Africa, mostly starting from Zanzibar Collapse of Ottoman Empire literature on the refugees of Ottoman collapse often asserts qualitative differences between the experiences of “Armenian” internally displaced peoples and those of “Muslims” during the same period of tragic events throughout the last half century of Ottoman existence, but the crucial factor here was the very fact one group of victims of war was “Christian” and the other “Muslim.” The difficulty with breaking out of this neat, but ethically suspect binary compass is that the tools available to the historian often seem inadequate. Generic categories such as sectarian or ethno-national identity used to capture an “experience” as vast as famine do so to distinguish particular categories of people from others, not to explore the actual diversity of experiences and fluid contexts. - pg 136-137 It is even more disappointing when the scholarship invokes sect, tribe, and ethnicity to try to explain what happens in these same territories when facing a constant flow of refugees, migrants, missionaries and “foreign” troops. 89 Again, while there have been challenges to the superstructure of “Ottoman Studies” and the epistemologies that confine the study of “Pan-Islam” to a “universal” struggle with “Christianity” or “the West,” unless we disaggregate with specific cases the categories of analysis, in other words, complicate them to the point they no longer have any meaningful value as explanatory tools, we simply repeat the essentialist “crimes” of the past. - pg 138 Conclusion What’s the recipe for a Turk? Take the 25 de Março [downtown São Paulo market district] street cocktail shaker and put in a Syrian, an Arab, an Armenian, a Persian, and Egyptian, a Kurd. Shake it up really well and—boom—out comes a Turk. [Guilherme de Almedia] - Turco de mierda . . . Turco bruto

The consequences will likely prove destabiliz-ing, both locally and beyond. Opposition to an entrenched political elite may take a more violent turn if citizens realize that yet again, voting in elections will not result in real change. That would further expose the clear divergence of strategic in-terests that has arisen among NATO partners dur-ing the Trump era. Without the prospect of nego-tiations for EU membership, Brussels risks losing influence in Albania, Kosovo, and North Mace-donia.

Why is a problem yours? 2 - Scientific Freedom and Transformative Research Discussion Inprecision of what is transformative research This may be actually deliberate, so not to exclude things you can&rsquo;t solve Can you separate the scientist from the problem? Do solutions have to be structured? How do scientists see themselves? Are the hard problems the important problems? How do we select for ideas? Are good ideas expected to bubble up ot the top? Should we select for problems that can&rsquo;t be separated? Some problems are hard, but they can be separated, but this is orthongal to being hard Braben conflates the difficult &amp; the interesting Expand/exploit for problems? When are you expanding into new fields? Why is freedom important Monte Carlo methods random walks Generates higher variance, but not necessarily better results Freedom is actually a constratining factor because now you no longer need to worry about scale success attracts other people, and that in turn becomes ossification localism each field must define what their freedom is VC funding inputs/outputs are both money &ldquo;do things that don&rsquo;t scale&rdquo;? 3 - Mismanagement by Objectives objectification adoption of math where it does not apply? economics, sociology, etc aligns with china&rsquo;s &ldquo;china is run by engineers, US is run by lawyers&rdquo; enormous expenditures -&gt; viruses are still killers -&gt; isn&rsquo;t this objectification grants are not mentored &ldquo;eastern medicine&rdquo; -&gt; orientalist approaches here federal funding and freedom do not necessarily generate better approaches middle east studies had freedom for quite a while reshaping of capital markets post-2008 is the post-WWII euphoria Braben identifies real? Or is it just because of cheap money? no investor seeking long term gains expects decisive short term returns Discussion Freedom/secrecy are at conflict open science vs open source? secrecy for whom? can we enable younger scientists? consensus popularity age increases china? empowering younger researchers? chinese science statistics need for harmonization capping discoveries? Everything is made by consensus? peer review, collaborators universities as a force for social change? are we just admitting too many people? Are the measurements bad? Should we stop measuring output? Or at least limit time-forward metrics? Up or out promotion paths? Calling out a focus on efficiency? Mitchel: Economentality? Redudancy is valuable -&gt; gives replication Legibility of research measure outcomes -&gt; is this reading the arrow backwards from assessing invidiual people? the shift in the 70&rsquo;s seems to be a mentality shift: science is no longer generically good science needs to illuminate the future metrics result in consensus because everyone aims towards the same thing make scientists as early as possible? stop treating scientific freedom as a reward? popular media -&gt; science has become homogenized Lenin was a mushroom What is consensus good for? 4 - Searching for Planck&rsquo;s Successors Threat Fatigue -&gt; losing signals in all the noise Adventure fund attempted to fund &ldquo;risky&rdquo; research in the UK in 2002 Braben suggests that peer review and consensus are the problem scientist reputations are slowly earned and quickly damaged - 108 responsbility shared is responsbility denied searching for the &ldquo;best value for money&rdquo; is what&rsquo;s leading to the reduction of risk can this be harnessed? Can we capitalize on the risk somehow? Braben suggests that confidence in your research leads to significant and transformative research TR must select for &ldquo;visionaries&rdquo;, not just glory-seekers measure devotion/hunger how? signals for these are quite bad Musical chairs with the rules are what&rsquo;s being attempted with the smaller fixes on the grant cycle, we need to rethink all of it langlands program and TR, how did this come about?

Every N milliseconds:
Pick a random set of keys (say, 50): Check how many have expired If the number is &gt; 25%, then evict and repeat Otherwise evict and sleep for N milliseconds I couldn&rsquo;t actually find any information that detailed this, although I did find a blog post about the LFU and LRU policies around Redis eviction policies circa 2018. I found something similar to what the author was referencing in the source, although that doesn&rsquo;t seem to exact be it either: https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/5.0/src/evict.c#L531-L5501.
Nevertheless, this simple algorithm spawned a discussion between me and a friend on how these probablistic algorithms have fat tails, and the assumptions that this algorithm makes. For example, for this simple random eviction policy to work, all the values need to be within a constant range of sizes. If you have a few values that are magnitudes larger than others, at enough scale you could end up in situations where the random scanning algorithm fails to catch the fat values for multiple cycles, which then puts more pressure on the eviction policy.
My friend then pointed to https://research.google/pubs/pub48030/, a paper that describes some of the issues with the remote caching mechanisms. The paper itself is worth reading, although the problems it recapitualtes will be familiar: serialization costs are annoyingly high, protocols add an additional layer of complexity, the usage of a K/V model means that you could be attempting to read an entire JSON blob when you just need a single element, and that network latency is non-trivial.
I think the bulk of the problem here comes from the implication that the cache should not be co-located with the caller. The addition of &ldquo;cache managers&rdquo; such as Redis Sentinel and distributed Memcache are a concession to this: caches cannot typically be held within a single machine, and that optimal performance requires the cache to understand more than just the actual data: the caching layer must have some additional meta-information on how the caller is planning on using it. The Google paper makes the case for an intrusive, distributed in-process cache that effectively acts as a smarter remote cache, which can learn from your calling patterns. This isn&rsquo;t too different from Erlang&rsquo;s ETS. The idea is that we can cut down dramatically on serialization and network hop costs by reducing the amount of information read with native language constructs, which I&rsquo;m in full agreement.
However, all of this makes the assumption that we can&rsquo;t deploy fat, tall servers where your cache is co-located with your application. Obviously the Google paper does not attempt to address this point because it&rsquo;s not feasible for Google, but this type of co-location might be easier than you&rsquo;d expect. In the past I&rsquo;ve successfully run very tall servers co-located with Kyoto Tycoon and communication over Unix sockets. We&rsquo;re not locked into the single small server model, the fat server model also solves the problems of network hops by removing it and solves the overreading problem by simply assuming that the costs of IPC communication is so low compared to the network hop that the extra data doesn&rsquo;t matter. While this design certainly won&rsquo;t work at large enough scale, I think it&rsquo;s actually fairly difficult to run into real world problems that scale further than this if you&rsquo;re not at FAANG scale.
I always forget how readable the Redis source is until I go back to it.&#160;&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;

Summary The researchers showed that using biases are inherent to the statistical frequency of specific words - distributional hypothesis in linguistics They developed a method similar to the Implict Association Test called Word Embedding Association Test, which measures the cosine similarity of specific words. Largely a study that shows that all the stereotypes and biases show from the IAT are apart of word embeddings, meaning that bias is not necessarily escapable here by tuning the dataset Note that this only captured word embeddings and only captured Glove. Likely, if not certain, that the same biases are in fasttext or w2v Paper was from 2017, so no mention of sentence embeddings Relates specifically to the work done by Bolukbasi et al who proposed a method to debias word embeddings (T.

Most systems in early distributed relational design did not take into account partition tolerance (aka mostly CA) network partition puts pressure on strong consistency and high availability strong consistency and performance have tension during normal operation how consistent does your data actually need to be - if availability is necessary, then we need to explore whether consistency models other than strong consistency are workable consistency and availability are not binary choices unless you limit yourself to strong consistency - https://www.infoq.com/articles/cap-twelve-years-later-how-the-rules-have-changed/ not really &ldquo;2 out of 3&rdquo; more like &ldquo;2.5 out of 3&rdquo; ACID != CAP Details 3 properties consistency: all nodes see the same data at the same time availability: node failures to not prevent survivors from continuing to operate partition tolerance: system continues to operate during message loss only two can be satisfied CA: strict quorum protocols like two phase commit Does not distinguish between node failures and network failures stops accepting writes to avoid introducing divergence two phase commit and common in relational db&rsquo;s CP: majority quorum protocols like Paxos prevents divergence by forcing asymmetric behavior on two sides of the partition drops the minority partition incorporate network partitions into their failure model Paxos, Raft, viewstamp replication, etc AP: conflict resolution protocols like Dynamo Strong Consistency vs Other Consistency Strong linearizable consistency - all operations execute atomically in a globally real-time ordering sequential consistency - all operations execute atomically in a order consistent with the order seen at individual nodes that is equal at all nodes not composable! Weak client-centric - client id or session id may guarentee that the client never sees old data (aka some kind of caching on the client end so they never read from old replicas) causal eventual - if values stop changing, then at some undefined point in time all nodes guarenteed to share the same value usually defined in a more strict manner like &ldquo;eventually last writer wins&rdquo; https://arxiv.org/abs/0909.1788 `}),e.add({id:254,href:"/posts/capability_trap_blog_post/",title:"capability trap blog post",content:`Tags: writing

Corvids, for example, can reason without speech “Being unbounded and freed from stimulus control do not necessarily exceed the bounds of mechanical explanation&quot; Chomsky begins to formulate the idea of computationally enumerable vs computationally finite &ldquo;It seems to be that the most hopeful approach of today is to describle the phenomena of language and of mental activity as accurately as possible&rdquo; - pg 12 argues that we must stop attempting to link postulates with approaches, and read the behaviors for what they are Wilhelm von Humbolt - 1830’s - &ldquo;the speaker makes infinite use of finite means&rdquo; Chomsky therefore says that the grammar must contain a finite system of rules that generates infinitely many deep and surface structures talks about Port-Royal theory to modern structural and descriptive linguistics latter restricts itself to the analysis of &ldquo;surface structure&rdquo; - formal properties that are explicit in the signal and to phrases and units that can be determined from the signal by techniques of segmentation and classification Ferdinand de Saussure, at the turn of the century, stated that the only methods of linguistic analysis are segmentation and classification syntagmatic (patterns in the literally succession in the stream of speech) paradignmatic (relations among units that occupy the same position in the stream of speech) `}),e.add({id:284,href:"/posts/chomsky_syntatic_structures/",title:"Chomsky - Syntatic Structures",content:`books, chomsky

Week 4 Writeup In doing this week&rsquo;s readings, I thought to myself how we should curse Fukuyama not for writing &ldquo;The End of History?&rdquo;, but causing the deluge of writings that came after, talking about how hypocracy is built into the liberal system. Like an endless parade, papers like Hansen and Stepputat go around presenting the modern state&rsquo;s actions as some sort of gotcha, as if the prior work hadn&rsquo;t made that already clear. The reconquest of the Iberian pennusla began the the illiberal state, a place where only one &ldquo;type&rdquo; of people were deemed allowed to reside (type being religious, racial, class, etc). Centuries of religious wars followed, then the rise of the modern liberal state, where groups not fitting into the predominant type were allowed under fiat, then the rise of the modern democratic liberal state, a system that califies the majority/minority relation at inception while simultanously causing the majority to agitate over the potential of losing their majority position. Thus states perform soverignity, using acts of violence as spectacle or chilling effect, in the colonies (Arendt) or rebounding to home (Fanon) or as &ldquo;a weapon of reason and preservation of freedom&hellip;from outsiders&rdquo; (Hansen &amp; Stepputat 8), because states are fundalmentally unstable systems, and must consistently affirm their status. States are not like religious institutions, they do not have people who perform to them, and therefore must occasionally make themselves felt, or else states are at risk of fading away.
The post-colonial narrative arc is almost as dull, with the &ldquo;local soverienty&rdquo; becomes &ldquo;hybrid empire/local soverignty&rdquo; which then gets taken over by the empires, who impose their own forms of governance that both reflects the local existing power structures and (often racialized) structures from home. This then morphs into raw capital with the retreat of empires, which then local elites parlay into political capital, and convulsions then follow between those who take this post-colonial system as fact or challenge it.
The problem with both of these narratives, in attempting to write against the canonized discourse around states, find themselves becoming pale reflections. Early orientalists certainly used the Orient as a stage, but their lack of understanding also meant that they unquestioningly reproduced local, dominant discourse as well. We are at the same risk if we can only conceptualize the state and citizenship in the same manners.
To that end, most of the readings bring up the role of capital and resources, but do not attempt to link it to the political schema. I think this is an oversight when considering the (post)modern state. The Hadramis of last week parlayed their consistent culture into creating a unified plane to conduct commerce, their culture became a sort of arbitrage, overlaying on top of the trading differences between the Islamic and Chinese empires. Neoliberalism has done the same for a generation of global elites by creating a consistent plane to conduct commerce. The Goldman Sachs bankers were the first to capitalize on this, but plutocrats and criminals alike have utilized this abstract plane to build global commerical empires. I believe the linkages between citizenship and commerce are undervalued in this regard.
Week 5 This week&rsquo;s readings focused on the usage and production of gendered differences by states as a marker of citizenship. Lebanon seems to be the most well-documented case of this, with Mikdashi looking at how the Lebanese state bureaucracy sets up different distinctions between sect and citizenship and gender and citizenship. The Surkis reading examines gender and citizenship through the lens of the French colonial imagination, and the implementation of different rights via gendered fantasies about the colonizer and the colonized. The Miller reading steps into discussing abortion and the transference of legal codes between the French and Italians to the Ottoman and Turkish systems.
What all of these readings this week have in common is the discussion of gender-based on life&rsquo;s conception. Discussions of abortion and jus soli/sanguinis are all contracts between the state and its subjects on the regulation of life. Building on top of Foucault&rsquo;s work, this area of biopolitics is fertile ground for writing because it is so easily refracted through state practices, nearly every practice of the state can be examined through this lens. Whether it is Mikadashi&rsquo;s Lebanese subjects who claim freedom via a common, secular Lebanese identity or French colonial administrators of Algeria canonizing polygamy into administrative law. In large part, we see a state that is intent on the production of differences, even when those differences may not be salient.
Referring back to week two, the story of citizenship is also a story of mobility and arbitrage. I am reminded of the recent legalization of Colombia, where the Constitutional Court of Colombia ruled to legalize the procedure, following the legalization of abortion in Mexico and Argentina. The domino narrative commonly presented in media about Colombia&rsquo;s legalization asks the question of where do states first conceive of gendered differences between their citizens, and how do they respond to changing social conditions? In the Surkis reading, the fact is very clear, the imposition of French codes, refracted through a prism of orientalist assumptions served to create gendered differences. The Miller reading spends less time on this, but still discusses the transplantation of already gendered legal codes. Beyond just a jurisprudential history, I think it is useful to think about where states draw their conceptions of gender from because it reveals cracks in bureaucracy and legal procedures that people are exploiting or suffering from. The Mikdashi reading shows us that record corrections are the primary way the Lebanese state views its citizens because the Lebanese state depended on a similar process to render the sectarian tensions legible.
If every state draws upon gendered narratives in the creation of the system of citizenship, does that mean that gendered narratives spread more easily across state lines? The abortion domino story in Latin America seems ascendant, but I&rsquo;m not sure if a similar pattern has occurred in MENA. However, I do think it is possible to push beyond thinking about Locke&rsquo;s anthropological minimum when thinking about gender, rather than framing the discussion around birth, it would useful to consider how states reach equilibrium on the production of gendered differences.
Week 6 The construction of the passport in this week&rsquo;s readings is largely focused on how passports are develop into a mediating tool from states to subjects. Crucially, we see in Torpy that subjects often invite and desire structures such as the passport in, rather than just the state mandating the passport. Racism plays a central part in McKeown&rsquo;s reading, where economic and medical differences are exploited to prevent or allow specific types of migration. Gutman, by focusing on internal mobility, complicates Torpy&rsquo;s deterministic linkage of illberal regimes and internal mobility. Mongia focuses on how the production of nationality occurs via the mechanisms of passports.
The medical question felt ironically underaddressed by this week&rsquo;s Focualdian type studies. McKeown was the only one that attempted to address this beyond a throwaway line about inspections, but his analysis relegates the medicial dimension to another form of standardization. In my view, this is a misunderstanding of medicine, because medicine is one where subjects invite the state most clearly in. Medicine is intensely private to the individual, and presenting vaccination records is very different than presenting a passport. Oftentimes, these medical restrictions take the form of blood tetss. Blood tests are self-attesting, one can present themselves at a border and take a blood test to attest that they do not have specific transmittable diseases. The assumption is that blood tests prevent transmittable diseases
What is interesting is the question of use: do blood tests at borders actually prevent transmittable diseases? The last time I attempted to renew my KRI visa, I had to take a blood test (after suffering through the classic MENA visa offices). However, the blood test was only necessary on renewal after I had already been there for 30 days. Assuming I had a transmittable disease, it seems statistically unlikely that the 30 day mark would matter for transmission. It seems clear that the KRI attempts to straddle the line between convienance and public health: they cannot reasonably test every traveler, and therefore only test the ones that are staying for longer, potentially opening up risks of infection, seemingly defeating the point of blood tests.
Contrast this to the refugee testing policy of the KRI [1]: Syrian refugees must take a blood test upon conversion from &ldquo;visitor&rdquo; to &ldquo;asylum seeker&rdquo;. While this distinction may seem bureaucratic in nature, the &ldquo;visitor&rdquo; category inherently limits internal migration due to being limited at 30 days (one cannot pass a checkpoint with an expired &ldquo;visitor&rdquo; identification). This marks a difference between historical medical checks: rather than attempting to use medical checks to limit who comes in, the goal has shifted to limiting who gets to move around internally.
[1]: https://help.unhcr.org/iraq/en/rights-and-obligations/civil-documentation-and-residency/, fustratingly, this is the only English document that talks about the location of the Duhok residency office. Also interesting to note that Syrian refugees and native Kurds have freedom of movement, not necessarily freedom of work location. Arabs from federal Iraq have neither: their internal visa (without a work sponsor) is valid only for a month and controls both movement and work.

Pöpper called that monocausotaxophilia, the love of single causes that explain everything.” (Kim Stanley Robinson, New York 2140) “Rather than jump to the idea that there was an adversary or some deliberate act, we find all the time that complex systems have this signature that these small failures build up combined to create a lot much larger consequence.” (Instapaper, Instapaper) “Besides, programmers could easily insert this extra test and loop. The MIT guy pointed out that the implementation was simple but the interface to the functionality was complex. The New Jersey guy said that the right tradeoff has been selected in Unix — namely, implementation simplicity was more important than interface simplicity.” (Rise of Worse Is Better) “We have been conditioned to believe that computers render the world clearer and more efficient, that they reduce complexity and facilitate better solutions to the problems that beset us, and that they expand our agency to address an ever-widening domain of experience. But what if this is not true at all? A close reading of computer history reveals an ever-increasing opacity allied to a concentration of power, and the retreat of that power into ever more narrow domains of experience.” (James Bridle, New Dark Age) How do sophisticated systems render complexity more “legible”? `}),e.add({id:325,href:"/posts/complexity_is_not_a_vice/",title:"complexity is not a vice",content:`Tags: drafts

US The Senate’s consent to ratify the CTBT requires the acknowledgement of a central reality: The United States is not going to resume nuclear testing after a 28-year moratorium. The Stockpile Stewardship program is a major success story. Its continued bipartisan support is assured. The nuclear labs have answered the questions that Senators like John Warner (R-VA) and Dick Lugar (R-IN) had at its inception, leading them to conclude that it was premature to vote for ratification in 1999. Twenty years later, we have the answers Senators Warner and Lugar were looking for. If the Nevada test site isn’t going to be shaking Las Vegas again, we might as well bring China, India and Pakistan into the fold. Two decades later, every significant qualm about the CTBT has been answered. The last lingering concern relates to whispers of tests at Russian and Chinese test sites.

two possible motivations for research technological: best performance on some applied task cognitive: single model with human-like performance across a broad range of abilities, plus biological/cognitive plausibility what does success look like? most nlu takes a behavioral approach, a modelis assumed to learn/understand iff can perform the task on data that wasn&rsquo;t used to build/train it (possibly) makes errors and uses resources similarily to humans note that this sets aside the question of &ldquo;what is understanding&rdquo;, &ldquo;what/when does conciousness emerge&rdquo;, etc what is the background for nlu need? two main questions:
how much does a system need? how much can it learn from data, how much built-in knowledge does it need? one big trend is that learning from the data is actually better than building explicit knowledge

Introduction Entailment When A entails B -&gt; when A happens, B happens
To reason correct, it is not enough if the presmises and conclusion is true, it needs to also be true if things happen differently.
Arguments whose premises entail the conclusion are \\(\\texttt{valid}\\), others \\(\\texttt{invalid}\\).
An argument is valid iff: under all circumstances in which the presmises would be true, the conclusion is also true.
An argument that is valid whose premises are true is called \\(\\texttt{sound}\\).
Quantifiers Example: {{&lt; hint danger &gt;}} a. Florida is north of no US state
b. No US state is north of Alaska
c. \\(\\cancel{\\therefore}\\) Florida is north of Alaka {{&lt; /hint &gt;}}
The quantifier here of \\(\\texttt{no US state}\\) is a shorthand ambiguity
Sentences are ambigious in nautral language
Two types of amibguity:
Scope amibguity - How you read the argument Lexical amibguity - When a word has multiple meanings Entailment vs Implicate Conversational implicate
Inferences that the listener can derive, assuming the speaker is adhereing to some axioms Maxim of Quantity -&gt; The speaker provides as much information as needed \\(\\texttt{Question under discussion}\\) -&gt; Subject matter at hand
Conversational implicative can be cancelled without producing a contradiction.
\\(\\texttt{Defeasbility test}\\) - Check if youy can construct an example where A is followed by the negation of B, and see if that still makes sense
Contrary opposition &amp; Contradictory Opposition {{&lt; columns &gt;}} A is contrary oppposition to B iff A &amp; B cannot be true in the same circumstance but both can be false &lt;&mdash;&gt; A &amp; B cannot be true together and cannot be false together {{&lt; /columns &gt;}}
{{&lt; hint info &gt;}} Note that negation is alwatys contradictory opposition. {{&lt; /hint &gt;}}
Tests {{&lt; columns &gt;}} Defeasbility Test - Attempts to form A &amp;&amp; \\(\\neg\\) B &lt;&mdash;&gt; Reinforcement Test - Attempts to form A &amp;&amp; B {{&lt; /columns &gt;}}
Entailment vs Presupposition Most negations of \\(\\neg\\) true are True Some negations are false Definition of presupposition {{&lt; columns &gt;}} Pragmatic -&gt; Something the speaker of a sentence does &lt;&mdash;&gt; Semantic -&gt; When a sentence presupposes something, the presupposed must be true in order for the sentence to be true. {{&lt; /columns &gt;}}
If you presuppose something false, the sentence is not true NOR false, but rather nonsense
Presupposition projects from the antecedent of the conditional
Projection Test Asses whether the inference in question projects over the negation Presuppositions thrive where entailments die
Truth Conditional Semantics Truth conditions are the situations in which the sentence is true, not whether the sentence is in fact true.

In a nutshell, Envoy is a “service mesh” substrate that provides common utilities such as service discovery, load balancing, rate limiting, circuit breaking, stats, logging, tracing, etc. to polyglot (heterogeneous) application architectures.
We knew that we had built a compelling product that was central to Lyft’s ability to scale its service-oriented architecture; however, we were surprised by the industry wide interest in Envoy following its launch. It’s been an exciting (and overwhelming) 7 months! We are thrilled by the positive reception and wide uptake Envoy has since received.

Remarks about the nature of historiography within Egypt during the 20th century.
Talks about how the formation of history, and therefore the conceptualization of a shared history (Anderson - Imagined Communities ?) was critical to the formation of an Egyptian identity Examines the writings and milleu of Muhammad Abduh Abdin archives Royal historiography Asks questions:
How much of european history is universal? How can arab histories be interpreted differently? Discussions Why Egypt and not necessarily other identities? Abdul and al-Banna? Did British colonialism provide the political scaffolding for Egypt to emerge? Does this book reflect colonialism, or does it reveal that our understanding of Egypt was too little? What is the difference between de-ottoman and post-ottoman? Chapter 1: Historicizing Ottoman Egypt From whence do we come, and where are we going? - pg 65 Increased urban planning and concepts of modernization during the years of Khedive Ismail Committment to Turkish/Ottoman culture was questioned at the end of the 19th century, which the British helped to spur Abduh acknowledged the loss of power for religious authorities Historicism is tackled as the supposition that an adequate understanding of human realiyy can be gained only through considering it in terms of the place which it secured for itself and the role which it played within a historical process of development - pg 29 Sabry Hafez states that novel ways of rationalization and perception are fundalmental to the emergence of new literary genres Strong ecumenical framing leaves with 3 questions: How does one tell history? What is its subject? Where does it take place? How does one tell history? Modern narratives are premised on the conception of history as a continous and progressive process (though not necessarily a linear one) - pg 37 Hints at Zaydan Ibn Fahmi wrote a historical book &ldquo;Al-Bahr al-zakhir fi tarikh al-alam wa akhbar al-awail wa-l-awakhir (The Bottomless Sea on the Events of World History) Referenced at ibn khaldun&rsquo;s notions of circular time Placing the present as no longer an extension/expansion/reptition of the past, but rather as an open and unbuilt place for the future Discovery of the future one of the most fascinating shifts in perception in Egypt - pg 61 Rescuing History from the Nation by Duara What is the subject of history? Egyptians had conceptualized by 1905 that history had a particular subject and historians traced out that subject Where does history take place? Khitta arabic word describes outline or freeform First conceptualization of Egypt as a cohesive whole forms in alignment with these historical narratives Chapter 2: Talking History British colonial apogee reached after the Dinshaway British soliders stumbled upon a tribe for fowl hunting, tribe defended, court and public execution energized public against colonialism Suez canal as nationalist symbol - pg 68 Proliferation of de-Ottomanization Egyptian culture treated Ottomanism precisely the same way that sixteenth-century Europe constrasted &ldquo;renaissance&rdquo; with &ldquo;medivalism&rdquo; and &ldquo;Hellenes&rdquo; with &ldquo;barbarians&rdquo; - pg 75 Taqwim al-Nil (Almanic of the Nile by Amin Sami) talked about the Nile in impressive detail, including canals and barrages (post-ottoman iraq/egypt irrigation essay) Egypt&rsquo;s first mass experience was the 1919 Revolution - pg 89 Chapter 3: The Abdin House of Records Genetically descneded from the Daftarkhane and a series of other collections Pinoneering attempt to establish a modern research archive, but also served as a place to mold, censor, and drive nationalist and nationalism ideas Site of intense competition for foreign translators, as well as foreign countries Italy and France both competed to translate and send documents, as well as print the books Accuracy problems, differences in censorship that eventually lead to Egyptians taking censorship as fact Cleanly based by King Fuad on french archival science Large part of the documents were focused on retrival of royal information and things related to construction of monarchist historiography Records cannot be considered to be whole, many are deliberatively censored Chapter 4: Competiting for History Abdin culimated with the advent of historical narration Overwhelming illteracy among the population, visualization of the past shaped via images in popular magazines, stamps, bank notes, statues, and street names, alongside radio and cinema - pg 146 Speaks about Muhammad Rif&rsquo;at Ardent Egyptian nationalist Work is well known but little studied, authored multiple volumes on the history of egypt Beginning with 1798, when Napoleon stepped foot on Egypt Considers anything before this &ldquo;nationalist jahiliyya&rdquo; Engaged in nationalist rwitings of history, in contrast to the monarchist ones Even-handed approaches to Muhammad Ali and Ismail `}),e.add({id:399,href:"/posts/diehl_and_druckman_not_the_same_old_way_trends_in_peace_operations/",title:"Diehl and Druckman: Not the Same Old Way: Trends in Peace Operations",content:`Tags: papers, un and global governance lecture 2

Uses the &lsquo;Bourdieusian method&rsquo; of political field where people vie to understand the influence of de-Ba&rsquo;atificiation and the creation of the Muhasasa Ta&rsquo;ifa appointment system.
Typical sectarian thesis is that ruling elites use sectarianism in order to bolster their own legitimacy. This assumes both a pilable public and awesome power of information spread.
habitus is used as a foundation for the understanding of political parties in Iraq, the mixed big-tent parties with intensely sectarian ones is because “it sees that agency as constrained by the boundaries of the possible set by the political field they are competing in as well as their own habitus” - pg 119
Similar to Hinnebusch - Identity and State Formation in Multi‐sectarian Societies, where sects are powerful but doesn&rsquo;t cut neatly alongside class, leading to some mixture.
&ldquo;Declaration of the Shia of Iraq&rdquo; asserted a Shi&rsquo;a Islamist principle originated by exiled elites by Saddam that later came into power.

4 ayatollahs, sistani is the marjah
Sistani&rsquo;s not-a-blessing of the UIA allowed it to win a significant majority in the 2006 elections, but frustration due to later corruption had him withdraw explicit support
The approach developed in this paper, broadly a “Bourdieusian” one, does not seek to discount the explanatory veracity of the sectarianisation thesis or the ethno‐symbolist approach. However, it seeks to broaden out the explanation and understand the causality behind it. The strength or weakness of these different identities is shaped by competition within political fields. The sectarian rhetoric that flourished after 2003 was not a return to nor a rejuvenation of previous identities suppressed under Ba&rsquo;athism. Instead, the success of sectarian entrepreneurs was driven by the way that the political field and the capital being fought over within it was transformed by the invasion and its aftermath. - pg 120

Domain Fronting in Signal What is domain fronting? History Cozy Bear in 2017 Signal in 2018 Blocked by google later on Reimplemented by google How do applications use it? Signal TOR Timeline of domain fronting in Signal Going forward Draft 1 Adopted by the encrypted messaging platform Signal since 2016, domain fronting has been a tool used for evasion of censorship and malware delivery. Domain fronting is a technique utilizing a well-documented loophole within TLS (see RFC) in order to masque traffic from one origin behind another, typically utilizing the infrastructure of Google Cloud Platform or Amazon Web Services. Notably, Signal uses domain fronting to evade censorship within Oman, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, and Egypt. First declared dead in April of 2018 by Google and Amazon, domain fronting has been quietly been used within Signal on Google Cloud Platform since April of 2019. This paper discusses the origins, the current progress, and the current Signal implementation.
History Domain fronting via The Onion Router (TOR) network gained widespread awareness in 2017 when it was used by the Russian hacker group Cozy Bear (also known as APT29) in 2017. Investigated by FireEye, Cozy Bear utikized domain fronting to distribute malware from what appeared to be appspot.com, a domain name used by Google as part of their cloud platform (https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/03/apt29_domain_frontin.html). Signal, a commonly used encrypted messaging app, has utilized domain fronting in the past in order to maintain connectivity behind countries that censor traffic, beginning in 2016 (https://signal.org/blog/doodles-stickers-censorship/). In March of 2018, Google moved to shut down the most commonly used endpoints for domain fronting within their cloud service splatform, forcing Signal to switch over to using Amazon Web Services, a similar cloud platform operated by Amazon (https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/commit/a573ab7c7668360c3ab411627bbb23109ef9facc). However, in May of 2018, Amazon moved to also shut down domain fronting within their platform (https://signal.org/blog/looking-back-on-the-front/), forcing Signal to find an alternative.
Technical Background Domain fronting requires knowledge of several pieces of internet infrastrure.
HTTP and HTTPS HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol) and HTTPS (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure) are web protocols used to request documents via the internet. HTTP is a plaintext protocol, involving a message body and various headers, containing information for user side applications to consume. Specifically a &ldquo;Host&rdquo; header denotes where the HTTP message came from, similar to a return address on an envelope.
However, as a plaintext protocol, any information sent via HTTP is readable to anyone, including censors, routers, even other users sharing the same Wifi network. HTTPS was specifically created to secure these messages, utilizing Transport Layer Security as a cryptographic protocol to encrypt messages.
TLS and SNI
Transport Layer Security (TLS), alongside with its predecessor secure socket layer (SSL), were originally introduced in 1999, but did not see mass adoption until the late 2000&rsquo;s. However, TLS by itself only mandates that a user and a host negotiate via a certificate exchange: a client requests a certificate from the server, and the client compares the certificate versus the expected result before proceeding with the document transfer. If the certificate does not match, the user is alerted and given a choice on how to proceed with the connection. This cryptographic process, also called the TLS handshake, allows the user and the server to agree on a cryptographic key to ensure that no one else can decrypt the messages passed between the user and the server.
However, TLS is used to establish a secure connection before any data is transferred via HTTP, since the correct cryptographic keys must be negotiated before the server starts to communicate data. This means that the data present in the &ldquo;Host&rdquo; header must be sent alongside the TLS handshake, even before any HTTP messages are sent. As a result, Server Name Indication (SNI) was added as an extension to TLS (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6066#section-3) in 2003.
Cloud Platforms Cloud platforms such as Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure, and Alibaba Cloud, along with smaller players, allow programmers to run their code on servers owned by Amazon, Google, Microsoft, or Alibaba, respectively. While each cloud platform has multiple options for programmers to run their code, this paper will focus on three product offerings used for domain fronting in the past: Google App Engine, Google Cloud Functions, and Amazon Souq. Google App Engine is a simple, lightweight way for programmers to write code meant to be executed for the web. All applications deployed on Google App Engine use the same base domain when running code: appspot.com. For example, a developer creating an application called &ldquo;test-app&rdquo; would have the domain test-app.appspot.com.
Google Cloud Functions is a similar product offering to Google App Engine, with many similarities, including allowing developers to run custom code behind the same domain: cloudfunctions.net.
Amazon Souq is a subsidary of Amazon acquired in 2017. The website offers much of the same products as Amazon, and now has mostly been rebranded with the main Amazon brand, but retained a distinct domain called cms.souqcdn.com. This domain was used for a content distribution network (CDN), which mirrored static website assets such as images to be physically closer to users, enabling faster data transfer rates.
Implementation of Domain Fronting and the Use Case of Signal Common censorship mechanisms employed by Iran, the United Arab Emirates, Turkey, and others is SNI filtering and domain name server (DNS) filtering. While the specific implementations of these censorship models are beyond the scope of this paper, both involve inspecting packets as they flow from the user to servers, checking for specific information, typically the &ldquo;Host&rdquo; denoted in the SNI tag, as well as any information for plaintext HTTP. This is a &ldquo;cheap&rdquo; censorship: filtering in this manner is computationally cheap, meaning users will typically not see a huge decrease in internet speeds, and monetarily cheap, as it is easy to implement with off the shelf solutions. For example, Turkey employed both SNI filter and DNS filter in late Feburary 2020, blocking Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram (https://netblocks.org/reports/social-media-blocked-in-turkey-as-idlib-military-crisis-escalates-r8VWGXA5) during the incursion into Idlib.
Domain fronting can bypass SNI filtering and DNS filtering, because HTTPS requests wrap the plaintext HTTP information with TLS. similar to a letter with one return address on the outside, but containing another envolope with a different return address on inside. In this analogy, the return address on the outside might be google.com, while the return address on the envelope contained would say signal.org. Here, this &ldquo;return address&rdquo; is the Host header within a HTTP request. Because the censor cannot open the envolope due to the cryptographic guarentees provided by TLS, it must decide whether to censor the outer envelope entirely, thereby blocking google.com, or allow the letter to pass through.
Further extended, domain fronting can be used by any actor from any Cloud Platform, as long as the CDN or the cloud platform is not completely blocked. Because of this, domain fronting through Google Cloud Platform is not available in the People&rsquo;s Republic of China, due the complete block on google.com.
Signal first outlined their usage of domain fronting in December of 2016 (https://signal.org/blog/doodles-stickers-censorship/), utilizing domain fronting from Google App Engine, or appspot.com. This presented most censors with the choice to either block a large portion of Google traffic and potentially rendering Google Services unusable. However, Google later announced that it was shutting down domain fronting (https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/pull/7584).
As a result, Signal switched over to using Amazon Souq for domain fronting in March 2018. Later that year, Amazon also decided to announce they were shutting down domain fronting in May of 2018, but quietly allowed it until April 2019 (https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/8736). This was fixed within later versions of Signal, although Open Whispher Systems has chosen to be mute on the details.
In digging into the Signal Android and Signal iOS code, we can see that the problem was resolved as of commit https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/commit/9aed2343c141b1b3809f7eaccce61c22e342fda7, with an amusing commit message of &ldquo;Attempt to resolve connectivity problems for some users&rdquo;. Notably, the SignalServiceUrl has been appened with specific sections for Egypt, UAE, Oman, and Qatar. In changing from the cms.souqcdn.com to google.com, it is clear that Signal is now using domain fronting via google.com.
However, as noted above, Google shut down the capacbility to use domain fronting in 2018. It becomes clear upon further digging that the SERVICE_REFLECTOR_HOST constant has changed from europe-west1-signal-cdn-reflector.cloudfunctions.net from textsecure-service-reflected.whispersystems.org. In digging into the iOS version of the Singal application, this constant is defined as censorshipReflectorHost, which is then called within https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-iOS/blob/13a69e3af350f77e3abb4f6c85b9229e4dc4cf3d/SignalServiceKit/src/Network/OWSSignalService.m#L243, a portion of code that specifically calls for the HTTP &ldquo;Host&rdquo; header.
As mentioned above, cloudfunctions.net is a service provided by Google Cloud Platform. Due to Signal&rsquo;s parsing of the host header from this domain, we can assume that, despite not seeing the code that powers europe-west1-signal-cdn-reflector.cloudfunctions.net, domain fronting is still being used.
What now? While cloudfunctions.net is a Google domain and presents most of the same challenges for censors as blocking google.com, it is concievable that censors could filter cloudfunctions.net by restricting access to certain functionality within Google Cloud Platform. Cloud functions are one of the many products offered by Google Cloud Platform, and, as in the case of China and Amazon Web Services, Amazon does have a special version of Amazon Web Services made for the Chinese market (https://www.amazonaws.cn/en/), which includes different functionality and products. This means that, at some point, these Middle East countries could ask Google to comply by restricting the product offerings.
However, domain fronting remains an effective way of circumventing censorship by effectively camoflaoughing network traffic. Even if this particular domain fronting endpoint is shut down, it would be a matter of time before another domain was found, as in the case of Signal moving from Google Cloud Platform to Amazon Web Services, and back to Google Cloud Platform once again. It is conviacble that further attempts to crack down on domain fronting would see Signal move to Microsoft Azure, or even Alibaba Cloud.

In &ldquo;Violence and History: A Response to Thandika Mkandawire&rsquo;&rsquo;, Stephen Ellis puts forth the notion that analysis of violence must be grounded in a historical context in order for proper analysis. Starting as a response to THandika Mkandawire, who originally criticized Ellis&rsquo;s work, Ellis deconstructs Mkandawire&rsquo;s theory of an urban/rural divide as the principal driver of violence within Africa. Going beyond this, Ellis pushes violence into a historical background, stating that the context of violence, mediated through symbols and modern habits, requires history to properly understand. While his research is predominantly focused on Liberia and the civil war that occured, his theory is focused on violence as a tool, guided by history, and demands proper historical understanding.
On its face, this argument is a convincing one. Features of modern political systems, such as parliamentary rules, were not willed into existence at a singular point. These features took centuries to develop, and if we treat violence as a single facet of society, we must also look at the development of violence throughout history. While we normally treat violence as an &ldquo;exceptional&rdquo; condition, a condition that is reached only under specific circumstances, this leads to treating violence as a unchanging, transtemporal mechanism. This is a moral and legalistic view of violence, which Gilligan asks us to abandon. However, by treating violence as just another tool used in society, we can begin to examine how it develops.
However, it is also easy to see how evaluating violence within a historiographic framework can fall into conceptions of primordialism and essentialism, which formed the basis of Mkandawire&rsquo;s critique. Studying the development of violence with a historical perspective carries the danger of overemphasis of history and de-emphasis of the agency of people. This type of reductionism already exists when describing nationalism, ethnicity, and sectarianism, such as the stress on the Sunni/Shia/Kurd divide in Iraq. While the commonly accepted understanding is that these three sects within Iraq have long held enmity towards one another, leading to the artificial state narrative, scholars such as Fanar Haddad and Sara Pursely have argued that a coherent Sunni identity did not emerge until after 2003. These sectarian identities, like violence, are not transtemporal and static, and were instead shaped by historical circumstances.
The paper is weakest when Ellis draws some parallels between the history of lynching and the symbols of the Liberian civil war. Ellis finds that the history of lynching in the US bears resemblence onto how the most extreme forms of violence during the Liberian civil war were historically motivated. His framework here is conceptually shallow here, most forms of violence can be found to have some amount of historical rooting, as history is largely recorded by the victors. Victors are motivated to justify their own violence through a variety of means, which means that further violence, either in response to past actions or the continuation of past actions, can find quick justifications.

Sara Pursley, Familiar Futures: Time, Selfhood, and Sovereignty in Iraq, Stanford Studies in Middle Eastern and Islamic Societies and Cultures (Stanford, California: Stanford University Press, 2019). Ellis brings up the history of lynching in order to describe the complexities of violence. Lynching, Ellis states, had several transitional periods, from a mob rule period to a racial oppression period. He states that lynching accomplishes two goals: it is an element of communication that targets and excludes certain groups, and that lynching is a form of violence that exists outside of the state monopoly of violence, even during a stable state. These two factors, Ellis states, is similar to the various acts practiced during the Liberian civil war, which then in turn requires historical understanding. It is here that this framework of applying historical context to violence breaks down, it is fairly trivial to bend any situation that occurs during a civil war to fit Ellis&rsquo;s two goals. Even as Ellis finds the most extreme violence during the Liberian civil were were historically rooted, this framework remains conteputally shallow. Any act of violence can be found to be historically motivated, given that history as recorded is largely a victor&rsquo;s history. Victors are motivated to justify their violence, often times itself in history, rendering Ellis&rsquo;s framework shallow.
Ellis ends by calling for a re-evaluation of the historiography in order to understand the nature of violence. This is largely a convincing argument, for example, recent scholars such as Sara Pursely have called for a renewed interest in the 1959 Personal Status Law in Iraq, which many scholars ascribe to be the cause of the 1963 Ba&rsquo;thist revolution. While there exists large corpus of data on the law&rsquo;s effects, most analysis of the Personal Status Law devotes only a few sentences1. Understanding the historical context the Personal Status Law was written, we can understand the context of Ba&rsquo;thist violence in greater detail.

Draft Migrants suffer a litany of horrors on their path to their ultimate destination. Existing on the bounded continuum, migrants are labeled somewhere between &ldquo;refugee&rdquo; and &ldquo;economic migrant&rdquo;. This dual classification, with significant grey area in between, affords people different rights and treatment along the way. For example, the term refugee carries implies significant loss of agency, but garners international sympathy and affords access to certain institutions. &ldquo;Economic migrant&rdquo; garners more mixed reactions, but carries with it an implication of choice and some amount of dignity. Both of these labels have shown to inaccurately describe current migration flows, yet their usage persists in common discourse. The result is the responsibility of violence is attenuated between the actors encountered by the refugees: destination governments, governments of states in transit, and the initial government that caused the migration. However, I argue that the actors with the most responsibility for violence against migrants is not any singular or blocs of states, but rather any actor that engages in segregative biopolitics against migrants. This includes not only actors such as the EU or the United States, but also the UN.
This essay aims to explore the status of al-akharin, or &ldquo;the others&rdquo; in Lebanon as a case study, and its relationship to the refugee-economic migrant continuum. The akhariin are composed of three groups: Palestinians, Syrians, and foreign workers. Lebanon hosts a significant population of Palestinian refugees, whose relatively long term of stay has muddled makes it difficult to cleanly classify them on either pole. Syrians, given the relative recency of the conflict, lean more closely to the refugee end, while foreign workers, imported from Nepal, the Philippines, and other countries, lean further towards the economic migrant end. In addition, Lebanon&rsquo;s political system, carefully balanced through sects that require careful management of biopolitics, presents a country that steadfastly refuses long term settlement of any group, whether they be Palestinian, Syrian, or foriegn workers.
The neologism of &ldquo;segregative biopolitics&rdquo; is borrowed from Aslı Iğsız footcite:igsiz_humanism_2018, describing the racialized taxonomy that occurs when evaluation of migrants. This taxonomy on the international level constitutes what Iğsız terms &ldquo;another terrain of population management&rdquo;, calibrated towards not only the process of migrating in, but also the process of deportation and assimilation.
The working terminology of &ldquo;refugee&rdquo; will be the one provided by Emma Haddad footcite:haddad_refugee_2001, describing a refugee as &ldquo;someone that has been forced, in a significant degree, outside the domestic political community indefinitely&rdquo;. The term &ldquo;economic migrant&rdquo; will be used as the contrary, describing someone that has not been forced, but still outside the domestic political community. Notably, these two definitions leave out the aspect of influence. It is commonly assumed that refugees, cut off from their homeland, have lower levels of agency and cannot influence history or their surroundings. Economic migrants are assumed to have &ldquo;given up&rdquo; the same agency when making the choice. However, this is hardly the case. Migrants leave a profound impact on the countries they arrive in and contribute to history as a &ldquo;contribute to History to such an extent that they may be at crucial moments considered a generative force behind&rdquo; footcite:blumi_ottoman_2013.
If the migrant is taken to have agency and not remain as a meme object of pity, as Blumi describes, then the actor left with the most responsibility for violence incurred is simply the one that prevents the migrant from exercising their agency, namely states and organizations that engage in segregative biopolitics. Migrants who are denied their agency are seen as objects of pity, and the reproduction of this stereotype requires refugees to be passive victims.
The structure of the essay will be the introduction of the concept of segregative biopolitics, the refugee/economic migrant continuum, and a short discussion on Hannah Arendt&rsquo;s people/territory/state trinity. Crawley&rsquo;s identification of categorical fetishism footcite:crawley_refugees_2018 will be used to set the stage for the main argument. The argument is then made that the UN, through the privilaging of refugees and usage of organizations such as the UNWRA that perpetuates the refugee stereotype, and bears equal responsbility to states that enact exclusionary policies. Two main points support the thesis: NGO&rsquo;s and the UN, through the channels of Permanent emergency and delcolonization footcite:duffield_development_2007 override the traditional social constraints. This strips away the identity of people concerned, resulting in the perpetuation of the refugee stereotype. Violence in this essay will be taken to expand beyond physical violence. Mental and temporal violence, such as subjecting migrants to substandard conditions without realistic hope of change is also another form of violence.
Lebanon will then be presented as the case study, going through a brief history of each of the three groups. For Palestinians, their relatively long stay in Lebanon will be used as the basis to analyze them as what Crawley described as refugees that became economic migrants. Saad Hariri&rsquo;s 2017 speech of the census of Palestinian refugees footcite:houssari_first_2017, in a country where an official census has not been taken in decades, will be examined as a starting point. Since a census is key to circumscribing the political terrain, the census of Palestinian refugees is a notable one. In addition, the preamble of the 1990 Lebanese constitution states &ldquo;no settlement of non-Lebanese in Lebanon&rdquo;, which is understood to refer to Palestinians shows how the Lebanese state degrades and causes violence against the Palestinians. In addition, UNRWA and the Palestinian Red Cresent and their effects of debasement upon the Palestinians footcite:chaaban_socio-economic_nodate are another source of violence.
The Syrian presence in Lebanon will be provided as an example of the refugee status. Their status, having not be formalized into mechanisms of the state yet due to their shorter term presence when compared to the Palestinians, is one of precariousness. However, because the Syrians have not been completely subsumed under the umbrella of UN/NGO/state organizations, their employment opportunities, especially with regards to militant groups, exists in much more of a grey zone. This gives exposes them to different actors who play on the agency of Syrian refugees, which diffuses the responsibility of violence in a different manner.
Finally, the foreign workers of Lebanon, who are the most easily classifible, will be presented. Given the revolving door status of these foreign workers, and the fact that there is exists no umbrella organization, the violence these workers face are diffused between the public, who employs them and cause the violence, and the Lebanese state, which fails to create laws to protect them. Human Rights Watch has documented many abuses against these workers footcite:noauthor_lebanon_2018. The foreign workers under the kafala, or sponsership, system are not mere observers as well, they have formed groups such as the Alliance of Deomestic Workers in Lebanon footcite:noauthor_alliance_nodate or the Migrant Domestic Workers Union footcite:noauthor_we_nodate. The inaction of the Lebanese state, including failing to address the problem of discrimination against non-Lebanese individuals footcite:arsan_lebanon_2018 is another form of violence.

Memes, alongside their production and consumption change banal reality into a fictionalized existence. Trump is a uniquely &ldquo;memable&rdquo; president, not only by literally a Game of Thrones meme when declaring the American withdraw from the JCPOA1, but also that he has had many moments that cross into the absurd. Take the infamous &ldquo;glowing orb&rdquo; photo, where Trump joined King Salman of Saudi Arabia and President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt, in the opening of a new anti-extremist center2. This appropriately generated endless discussions and image macros about its symbolism.
Yet this method of interpreting politics has exceed Trump as well. Take Biden&rsquo;s statement of &ldquo;inshallah&rdquo; during the presidential debate3. Endlessly debated on twitter until the Biden campaign confirmed it, scholars, activists, twitter pundits all piled on to offer their own interpretations of what it meant and the implications. Without meme culture, it&rsquo;s likely that Biden&rsquo;s usage would have been seen as something unique to the gaffe prone candidate. Yet the alacrity and the reach allowed the meme to exceed the original, suggesting that scale and speed are the two most important factors of a meme.
The production of memes is an inherently artificial process. This is not to say that the creativity behind memes are artificial, but rather they are artificial constructs and rely on a distinct &ldquo;original&rdquo;. Memes are always about this &ldquo;original&rdquo;, but add rich context. The humor of memes then arises from this context. It is unremarkable, for example, that a US president visit a civil service center in Riyadh, but to do it with King Salman and Sisi, and for the that US president to be Donald Trump? The context here is the history and ideology of these three men, and it is the fusion of this context with the image that gives the meme its humor. This is why humorous memes are difficult to create, the image macro and video itself are easy, but to neatly package all the context into a single frame is difficult.
This compression of information into a single, low-quality image is what makes American politics so digestible. Non-americans would never suffer through seasons of West Wing or House of Cards, but a single image is digestible. In this way, they are

Interviewing Strats Clarify the question: if the question seems unnecessarily hard, then clarify it work on concrete examples spell out the brute force solution think out loud apply patterns clarify assumptions that inputs are valid test for corner cases write unit tests if there is time add code checking for the result syntax - lots of bad syntax shows you have no coding experience memory management: avoid memory management opportunities all together keep the solutions short Bit Primitives integers in Python3 are unbounded, can use max of memory size sys.maxsize can be used to find word-size maximum value integer that can be stored in the word python does not have unsigned shifts, since integers have infinite precision how to use bitwise operators? how to use masks? fast ways to clear the lowermost set bit understand signedness and implications to shifting consider using cache for brute-forcing small inputs commutativity and associativity can be used to perform operations in parallel and reorder ops key methods for numeric types abs, math.ciel, math.floor, min, max, pow, math.sqrt floats are not infinite precision, and easy to refer to infinity as float('inf') and float('-inf') key methods for random: random.randrange, random.randint, random.random(), random.shuffle(A) and random.choice(A) parity - parity of a binary word is 1 if the word is odd, otherwise 0 parity checks are used to detect single bit errors in data storage and communication Arrays bisect.bisect and bisect.bisect_left and bisect.bisect_right gives you ranges for sorted lists that tell you where to put new elements so the list remains sorted bisect_right and bisect_left are one off for cardinatity 1 lists any([]) -&gt; False Strings strings in python are immutable concatenating a single character n times to a string in a for loop has O(n^2) complexity strings often have brute-force solutions that use O(n) but can be reduced to O(1) Linked Lists often conceptually simple, and more about cleanly coding what&rsquo;s specified consider using a dummy head to avoid checking for empty lists easy to forget update next/previous for head and tail algorithms that operate on singly linked lists often benefit from using two iterators example: hierarchical navigable small words, skip lists Stacks and Queues Stacks push/pop on a LL implemented stack has O(1) ops push/pop on an array implemented stack has O(1) ops, but maximum size, unless there is dynamic resizing, where the amortized is O(1) last-in/first-out semantics makes it good for making reverse iterators parsing typically benefits from a stack consider augmenting the basic stack or queue data structure to support additional ops Queue queue&rsquo;s with LL&rsquo;s have O(1) ops for enqueue and dequeue often has a &ldquo;peek&rdquo; operation push/inject for front/back ops in a deque note that you can use collections.deque() which has popleft and popright functions queues are ideal when order needs to be preserved Binary Trees full binary tree is when every node other than the leaves have two children perfect binary tree is a full binary tree where all the leaves are at the same depth, and every parent has two children 2^(h+1)-1 nodes -&gt; 2^(h+1) are leaves complete binary tree is a binary tree where every level is filled and all leaves are to the left as possible n nodes has height floor(log(n)) recursive algorithms are well suited to problems on binary trees you might be able to reuse existing tree nodes to reduce space complexity to o(1) consider left and right skewed trees when doing complexity analysis, O(h) complexity, where h is the tree height, translates into O(log n) complexity for balanced trees, and O(n) complexity for skewed trees &ldquo;parent&rdquo; field makes code simpler easy to make the mistake of treating a node that has a single child as a leaf Heaps Specialized binary tree complete binary tree that satisfies the heap property - the key at each node is as great as the keys stored in its children max-heap supports O(log n) insertions, O(1) time lookup, and O(log n) deletion of the max element. The extract max op is defined to delete and return max element sometimes referred to as a priority queue, each element has a &ldquo;priority&rdquo;, and deletion removes the element with the highest priority min-heap is a completely symmetric version of the data structure and supports an O(1) looked up for the minimum element you can use a heap to keep track the k lognest string in a streaming string system, each insert is log n time, and if you have a min-heap, you can choose when to drop use a heap when you care about the largest or smallest elements, and do not have to support fast lookup, delete, or search operations a heap is a good choice when you need to compute K largest or K smallest elements, former should use a min-heap, latter should use a max heap python has the heapq module to implement a heap, but it specifically only has a min-heap. Insert the negative for integers or floats, or for objects, implement __lt()__ appropriately Searching Search algorithms can be classifed in a number of ways. Is the underlying collection static or dynamic, and are inserts/deletes interleaved with searching? can you preprocess the data? are there special statistical properties of the data that can be exploited? should we operate directly on the data or transform it? binary search O(log n) search time, but requires a sort that takes at least O(n log n) time how do you implement a binary search? def bsearch(t, A): L, U = 0, len(a) - 1 while L &lt;= U: M = L + (U-L)/2 if A[M] &lt; t: L = M + 1 elif A[M] == t: return M else: U = M - 1 return -1 binary search is applicable than just sorted arrays, you can use it to search an interval of real numbers or integers if we use sorting, and the computation performed after sorting is faster than sorting, look for solutions that do not perform a complete sort general searching objects have comparable __lt()__ and __gt()__ for user defined types langauge already knows how to compare built-in types Hash tables Updating keys in hash tables -&gt; don&rsquo;t do it delete the key, then update it, then move it back keys should generally be not mutable we want to aim for rolling hash functions hash functions should examine all the characters in a string, and not let one character dominate we also want to implement a rolling hash function, where if one character is removed from the start and added to the end, it should not effect the final result Hash tables is a good data structure to represent a dictionary sometimes a trie gets used to store a dynamic set of strings, and has computational advantages when many letters are repeated anagram example: to find anagrams, you can preprocess each trail and sort, and append a list on the other side designing a hash table class you can implement __hash__, and hash is a builtin hash tables have the best theoretical and real world performance for lookup, insert, and delete. consider using a hash table as a signature to enhance performance consider using a precomputed lookup table when defining the own type that will be put in the hash table, make sure to know the relationship between logical equality and the fields the hash function inspects anytime equality is implemented, imperative that the hash function is also implemented sometimes a multimap can be used, which contains multiple values for single key hash table types set, dict, collections.defaultdict, collections.Counter set.remove raises an error if the value is not in the list set.discard does not alert if the value is not in the list note that not every type is hashable, mutable containers are notably not hashable Sorting sorting is a common problem naive sorting algorithms run in O(n^2) time, some run in O(nlog) time sorting table: sorting in place (O(1) space)? stable (duplicate items remain in the same order)? heapsort yes no merge sort no yes quicksort yes yes well implemented quicksort is usually the best choice for shorter arrays (&lt;10), insertion sort is easier to code and faster if every element is known to be at most k places away from its final location, a min-heap can be used to get O(n log k) algorithm if there are a small amount of distinct keys, counting sort works well if there are many duplicate keys, we add the keys to a BST, with linked list for elements which have the same key; the sorted result can be derived from an in-order traversal of the BST most sorting algorithms are not stable, mergesort, carefully implemented, can be made stable. most sorting routines are based on a compare function. It&rsquo;s also possible to use numerical attributes directly with radix sort sorted() returns a copy using __lt__ list.sort sorts in place time complexity of any reasonable library is O(n log n), most sorting functionalities are based on quicksort, which has O(1) space sorting problems usually come in two flavors: using sorting to make the subsequent steps in an algorithm simpler use a library sort function, possibly with custom comparator desinging a custom subroutine use a data structure like a BST, heap, or array indexed by values certain problems become easier to understand, as well as solve, when the input is sorted best when inputs have natural order, or preprocessing step to speed up searching for specialized input (very small range of values or small number of values), it&rsquo;s possible to sort in O(n) time sorting can be implemented with less space than required by a brute force approach sometimes it is not obvious what to sort on sort -&gt; inplace for list implements stable in place sort for list objects, returning None. takes two arguments, both optional: key - assumed to be a function which takes list elements and maps to objects which are comparable reverse - whether to sort in descending order, by default sort does it in ascending order to sort an iterable, use sorted() also take identical key and reverse objects Binary Search Trees BSTs are workhorse data structures and can be used to solve almost every data structures problem reasonably efficiently, and offer the ability to efficiently search for a key as well as find min and max elements Just a binary tree where the ndoes store keys that are comparable such as integers or strings Key lookup, insertion, and deletion take time proportional to the height of the tree, which can be worst-case O(n) some implementations of insert and delete which guarentee that the tree heigh is O(log n) Common mistake with BSTs -&gt; object that&rsquo;s present in the BST is not updated avoid putting mutable objects in the BST! If you must mutate, remove, update, then add it back BSTs give you the ability to find min and max elements, and find the next largest/next smallest element implement some kind of ordering alongside this, finding the min, the max, next largest/smallest, and lookup, delete, and find take O(log n) time both BSTs and hash tables use O(n) space BST implementation class BSTNode: def __init__(self, data=None, left=None, right=None): self.data, self.left, self.right = data, left, right def search_bst(tree, key): return (tree if not tree or tree.data == key else search_bst(tree.left, key) if k &lt; tree.data else search_bst(tree.right, key)) -Since the program that descends the tree with each step, and spends O(1) time per level, time complexity is O(h), where h is the height of the tree
We can iterate through the elements in sorted order in time O(n) regardless of balance Some problems need a combination of a BST and a hashtable. If you need to order something, you can use the dict to contain additional, mutable information, and the dict can contain direct elements in the tree Sometimes you need to augment a BST to make it possible to manipulate more complicated data such as intervals and give more complex queries, such as the number of elements in a range BST property is a global property - a binary search tree may have the property that each node&rsquo;s key is greater than the key at its left child and smaller than the key at its right child, but it may not be a BST NO BST LIBRARY IN PYTHON sortedcontainers or bintrees can be used Recursion Recursion is an approach where the solution depends partially on solutions to smaller instances of related problems Often appropriate when the input is expressed using recursive rules, such as computer grammar Searching, enumeration, divide and conquer, decomposing a complex problem into a set of similar smaller instance are all scenarios where recursion may be suitable A recursive function consists of base cases and calls to the same function with different arguments Two main ingredients for successful recursion: identifying the base cases ensuring progress A divide and conquer algorithm works by repeatedly decomposing a problem into two or more smaller independent subproblems of the same kind, until it gets to instances that are simple enough to be solved directly solutions to the subproblems are then combined to give a solution to the original problem divide and conquer is not synonmyous with recursion the problem is divided into two or more independent smaller problems that are of the same type as the original problem, recursion is more general, there may be a single subproblem, but the subproblems may not be independent (dynamic programming), and they may not be as the same type as the original (regex matching). In addition, sometimes to improve runtime and reduce space complexity, you can implement divide and conquer using iteration use recursion as an alterative to deeply nested iteration loops removing recursion can be done by mimicking call stack with the stack data structure recursion can be easily removed from tail recursive programs by using the while loop, no stack is needed if recursive functions may end up being called with the same arguments more than once, cache the results (aka dp) DP General technique for solving optimization, search, and counting problems that can be decomposed consider using DP when you have to make choices to arrive at the solution, especially when it involves subproblems key difference between divide-and-conquer and dp is that DP shows the same subproblem may reoccur Greedy Algorithms and Invariants greedy algorithms computes a solution in steps, at each step the algorithm makes a decision that is locally optimum, and it never changes the decision does not necessarily produce the optimal solution.

Easy way typically sums or averages the vectors together Two snippets of text are discovered by mapping both of them into vector space and finding the distances between the vectors
Typically uses the angular distance nearest neighbor can be used
high dimensional vectors of word embeddings typically break down approximate nearest neighbor must be used (ANN) uses hierarchical navigable small-world graph

Both properties of stochastic process, ensemble average is effectively the expected value, whereas the time average is a strict random variable.
Time average of a stochastic process is simply the average value of a single outcome of a stochastic process.
Modern economics tends to conflate these and use ensemble averages when a time average is probably better.

I feel like there are not very many Erlang PMs out there, especially with Erlang clusters at scale, so hopefully, this postmortem serves as one of the few examples to learn from. We experienced a service degradation that could&rsquo;ve amounted to an outage, but was solved with enough time to prevent an outage.
For context, we were running Erlang OTP 23.1 using an Elixir application with releases controlled by Distillery2, deployed on top of a Kubernetes cluster running on GCP. Our cluster was over 150 pods, with each pod containing a single elixir application instance running as PID 1.
At 7:23 PM UTC, when we received a massive traffic spike, the Kubernetes deployment began to autoscale and spin up new pods. Symptoms began to appear at 7:43 PM UTC, where we noticed that new pods were being killed and restarted by the Kubernetes readiness probe. Our readiness probe was set to 30s, meaning that if a single instance was unable to start within 30s, it would be killed and restarted. This meant that no new pods were able to join the cluster.
The cause was a library called pg23, which effectively manages cluster membership. During the traffic spike, 7 pods began to fall behind in cluster message processing. As the cluster rapidly scaled, these 7 pods, which were already behind, began to lag even further. However, new pods joining the cluster would consume outdated cluster information from these 7 lagging pods, since pg2 maintains a strong ordering of messages. Consumption and processing of these messages required on average 6 minutes and occur before the process is ready to take requests, which far exceeded the readiness probe limit, causing Kubernetes to repeatedly stop and restart, further adding to the number of messages that needed to be processed by future pods.
This slow cascading failure caused pods to start dying until the root cause was narrowed down with observer_cli4, at which point we rolled the deployment and the issue was resolved.
In the future, the resolution will be to update to pg with OTP 24, which maintains a similar API without maintaining strong ordering.
Timeline of Events 7:43 PM UTC - Massive traffic spike. 7:43 PM UTC - New pods cannot start, and new pods are constantly killed by the Kube readiness probe. 11:43 PM UTC - Managed to narrow down the issue to pg2, determined that a temporary resolution was to kill high memory pods 12:46 AM UTC - All 7 high memory pods were killed, and new pods were started 1:17 AM UTC - Completely rolled the deployment, issue resolved. Symptoms and Root Cause Erlang Configuration pg23 is a process group management library used in the BEAM VM for cluster membership. Erlang clusters by default are full mesh, meaning that each node knows every other node. Of course, this inherently limits the number of nodes, as message scaling is \\(o\\(n^2\\)\\) within the cluster.
The Erlang and OTP in Action5 mentions:
A cluster of Erlang nodes can consist of two or more nodes. As a practical limit, you may have a couple of dozen, but probably not hundreds of nodes. This is because the cluster is a fully connected network and the communication overhead for keeping machines in touch with each other increases quadratically with the number of nodes.
We are running a cluster with 150-200 Erlang nodes at any given time. In addition, our entire cluster runs on GCP preemptible instances, which means that nodes are liable to be killed at any time, generating far more intra-cluster bookkeeping messages. In other words, we&rsquo;re likely at the limit, if not over the limit of a full mesh network.
Kubernetes Configuration For us, each Kubernetes pod corresponds to a single container, which in turn corresponds to a single Erlang node.
Our pods are configured with a readinessProbes of 30s and a period of 10 seconds. This means that the process within the pod has 30s to start, and every 10 seconds we check the status. If the status check fails more than once, we kill the pod and restart it at the beginning.
Pods are deployed using a Kubernetes deploymentSet, which automatically spins up more pods as traffic increases.
The Issue Per the timeline above, the 7:42 PM traffic event triggered a cluster-wide scaleup. However, traffic already overloaded a few existing pods, which caused 7 pods to fall behind in traffic processing.
Because the BEAM VM implements TCP multiplexing, both connections to external clients and the rest of the cluster are handled on the same pipe, to conserve port usage. However, this means that, in rare cases, external traffic can cause resource starvation on cluster bookkeeping traffic, which is what I believe occurred here.
The 7:42 external traffic overloaded 7 specific pods. These pods, while processing external traffic, fell behind in processing cluster bookkeeping traffic, and therefore had a stale view of the cluster. In conjunction with the traffic, the massive scaleup Kubernetes initiated flooded the cluster with additional messages.
However, as new pods joined, the strong ordering property of pg2 meant that new pods needed to consume all messages from different nodes, including the stale messages from the 7 specific nodes. This processing exceeded the grace period given by Kubernetes, causing a repeated cycle of pods starting up, processing cluster messages, and being killed before they could finish.
Of course, as each pod was killed, Kubernetes attempted to restart the pod over and over. A cascading failure occurred: pods would start up, attempt to join, broadcast their membership, then be killed, adding more messages that needed to be processed by future pods. This means that each time Kubernetes attempted to restart a pod, the number of total messages that needed to be processed increased. A feedback loop of a slow start, getting killed by slow starts and making future starts even slower was established.
Diagnosis Root cause analysis was established with two experiments:
We took a pod that was repeatedly being rebooted and removed the probes and timed the startup observer_cli was used to determine what was taking up memory on high-memory pods. The first experiment established that pods were not unable to join the cluster, but rather they were just very slow to join the cluster. This meant that there had to be something with cluster bookkeeping, at which point we began to suspect something either with GCP or our cluster management code.
The second experiment clearly established that pg2 was the culprit. observer_cli is a tool for the BEAM VM that is similar to htop, allowing you to determine what is consuming CPU and memory. Running observer_cli on a specific node revealed that the majority of the memory was being consumed by pg2, which we suspected to be cluster bookkeeping messages.
Resolution It was determined that we should kill the seven high-memory pods to see if it would alleviate cluster traffic. After killing the pods, the effect was immediate: new pods began to spin up right away. After an hour, the decision was made to do a rolling deployment to create a completely new cluster state. New pods began to spin up without issue after the cluster state was cleared.
What I Learned Distillery does not have easy logs for startup We use distillery, which is a tool that handles generating startup code for deployments. However, distillery does not provide BEAM bootup logs, which greatly increased our debugging time.
gdb and strace don&rsquo;t work on the BEAM VM! With no information about BEAM VM boot, I attempted strace and gdb the PID. The first hurdle was that we run services as PID 1, and newer Linux kernels prevent stracing on PID 1.
The second hurdle was that even when switching the PID, strace doesn&rsquo;t work as expected on the BEAM VM! strace on the BEAM VM PID will only show SELECT(0, NULL, NULL, NULL), which is a syscall used for subsecond waiting. I&rsquo;m unsure what the root cause of this is, but I suspect this is because the BEAM VM uses greenlets and lightweight threads processing, which are invisible to strace on the root PID.
150-170 nodes is likely the upper limit for full mesh Erlang. The most important lesson is that 150-170 nodes are likely the upper limit. While we had easily scaled up to 120 nodes without problem, scaling from the Kubernetes autoscaler pushed us to a metastable failure6: a pathological state where once entered, the system is unable to recover by itself.

The Karbala ritual of radat (الردات الكربلائي سياسي, lit the karbala political responses) during Muharram is underdiscussed. Despite how many people try to use religion as a scrying sheet for political predictions in Iraq, very little discussion has been had on radat, a ritual that literally has &ldquo;political&rdquo; in the name! I recently tweeted about my favorite radat of late, and thought that I should elaborate on what it symbolizes.
What are radats Radats are performed by mowkebs (موكب), which are affilations that perform ceremonies and services for pilgrims during Muharram. Each mowkeb is different, typically with a name such as Abbasiyya, Bab Baghdad, Bab Najaf, etc. Before Ashura, there are around 300 mowkebs in Karbala, with 75-1151 of them performing majlis and radats. A radat is a chant performed around the Shrines of Abbas and Hussein:
[!insert vid]
Radats are necessarily political, but many mowkebs are famous for writing political ones. In particular, mowkeb Abbasiyya, one of the largest, has been mentioned as a particularly famous for being political in radat.
A radat at its core consists of a sign and a group of people. A mowkeb is split into a few groups (2+ usually), and they march from the shrine of Abbas into the shrine of Hussein. Each group carries a different poem, and they repeatedly while walking between the shrines. Notably, radat is usually performed by native Karbala mowkebs, and typically cease after Ashura, as most rituals turn towards religiously focused rather than politically focused.

Transcription: جيران الوطن كلهم أفاعي علي أتامروا فرهدوا كاعي كل العالم يشوف بكاعي الطامع يحوف يحسين انت رايه الحق هداية
Translation: All of neighbors of the homeland are snakes Against me they conspire to steal my land The whole world sees The thieves which roam my land
Oh Hussein you are the banner The true guide
الوطن can be translated in a variety of ways, although most people I talked to believed it to refer to Iraq-the-nation-state as a whole. If we take this as true, two things follow:
The chanters take the nation-state system as normative (that is, they are not haggling over the existance of Iraq) The chanters believe that they represent Iraq The usage of جيران is also interesting, since it could plausibly refer to Turkey/Iran/etc. If read to mean Turkey, this would be read on the Sunni/Shia axis. If read as Iran, this would be read as a Karbalaei independence from Iran axis, or intra-Shia split.
I think reading it from this angle occuldes the actual meaning of the radat. The desire to map the radat onto our preconcieved splits is easy, but national cleavages are not local ones. Kalvays warns us of this type of analysis in civil wars by telling us that master-narratives are accorded too much significance, and actions in civil wars are not necessarily political, but instead do not always reflect deep ideological polarization. In fact:
It is the convergence between local motives and supralocal that endows civil war with its intimate character and leads to joint violence that straddles the divide betwen the political and the private, the collective and the individual.3
In a similar way, I think there&rsquo;s the impetus to ascribe these narratives to local movements. The framing of the recent Sadrist protests as anti-Iran is redicious for similar reasons, Sadrists took to the streets not to protest Iran, but to protest for better conditions. Similarly, Muqatada Sadr himself is not anti-Iran, he is just as close to it as any other Shia leader in Iraq.
Karbala and Karbalaeis themselves have a complicated relationship with Iran. On one side, Karbala recieves money from Iran and Iranian pilgrims, which can be seen as a source of Iranian influence. However, another framing could be that Karbala is extractive, using its perch as a shrine city to extract resources from Iran. The relationship is ambigious, neither transaction nor ideological, meaning that the pro/anti Iran framing cannot be easily mapped here.
If we reject the master-narrative of sectarianism here, how else can we look at this radat? One framing is the narrative of universalism: the usage of watan and &ldquo;the whole world sees&rdquo; is a claim to that Imam Hussein is for all Iraqis. The master-narrative is to see the Shia as yet another partisan on the sectarian scale, with all three groups vying for resources and themselves. However, if we approach it from the logic of universalism, the Shia here do believe that they represent a particular Iraqi future, a different analysis opens. In the same way the UN espouses a human-rights based form of universalism, the Shia of mowkeb Abbasiyya are laying claim to a specific brand of nationalism. This framing is provides an escape hatch from wondering why people do not act on purely sectarian lines, and also properly accounts for Karbala&rsquo;s complicated relationship.
Note that these numbers may not be exact, I got them from the department of mowkebs on July 4th, 2022, and the number is constantly changing.&#160;&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;

He raised the axe, saying, If you say a word I will cut off your heads; and if you do not say a word, I will also cut off your heads.
Both monks continued their meditation as if he had not spoken. Ganto dropped the axe and said, You are true Zen students. He returned to Tokusan and related the incident. I see your side well, Tokusan agreed, but tell me, how is their side? “Tozan may admit them, replied Ganto, but they should not be admitted under Tokusan.

Overview &lsquo;sectarianism&rsquo; as a term is too broad and doesn&rsquo;t mean anything he suggests a 4 pillar approach, building on top of Hinnebusch - Identity and State Formation in Multi‐sectarian Societies doctrinal substate state suprastate Brubaker: Religious Dimensions of Political Conflict and Violence Religion is a necessary but not sufficient event for the formation of sectarian identities Skip past the fetishization doctrine and the pervasive binary of Sunni/Shia Also poor debates that unity is a manichean good that opposes sectarianism coexistence, intermarriage, and kinship are not a bar to the outbreak of hostilities context, flebility, and salience enough for raw symbolisism for everything to be framed everything is correlated - the context, flexibility, and salience make religious markers easy to adapt we cannot view things as a dichmoety of above/below, for elites are also the product of their own systems, so the cynical view of elites manipulating their system is false Formations of Sectarian identities Identity is a difference between contest vs contestation Weiss - In the Shadows of Sectarianism amman message (2005) and mecca declaration (2006) were doctrinal and had clerical buy in, but did bridge sectarian divisions religion is often times not the main driver but can fan the flames, schisms can create legitimacy for divisions &ldquo;To ask if sectarian dynamics are driven by religion or politics is to ask the wrong question. Seldom is it clearly one or the other: when it comes to how sectarian identities and sectarian relations are produced, both religious doctrine and politics are inescapable factors, with the balance between the two being dictated by context. A particular facet of sectarian identity - for example, personal status codes - may become a political issue, but this is neither inevitable nor impossible. Indeed, rather than a strict binary, politics and religion exist often in a reciprocal relationship characterized by circularity rather than antagonism or exclusivity - two separate but nevertheless intertwined concepts, to borrow from Brubaker&rsquo;s analysis of religion and nationalism&rdquo; (Haddad 2020:68)
sectarian problems are not reducible to religion shia&rsquo;s are less than 20% of all muslims excluding zaidi, less than 11% 60% of shia&rsquo;s are iraqi shia salience of identity does not match with the salience of politics the sunni sect is rooted in more opportunism, the shia idea is rooted in their persecution as a sect shia&rsquo;s then put a premimum on their minority status terms like nawasib and Wahhabi are used to demarcate who is a &ldquo;good Sunni&rdquo; and &ldquo;bad Sunni&rdquo; Shia polemics rarely ever frame ordinary Sunnis as a threat, even Yasser al-Habib refrains from this shia are often protrayed as a threat in sunni culture, but this is not the same This is because Shiis need the sunni recongition, while sunnis do not need shia recongition iran portrays itself as the vanguard of Islam sunni led pan-Islam does not need shiis shii-led pan-Islam does need Sunniso Maher - Salafi-Jihadism: The History of an Idea not every binary is balanced! leads to the question of how states shape sectarian relations? lebanon - lacking a strong central state Mervin - The Shi&rsquo;a worlds and Iran - Olivier Roy makes the point that Sunni/Shia tensions are more likely to be state-led than mass-led in current era, although this is not exclusively a state policy Azmi Bishara rejects the idea that the Sunnis are even a sect Hanf - Coexistence in Wartime Lebanon - intergroup conflict is more common in the clash of Jacobinistic, culturally blind views Safouan - Why are the Arabs Not Free? - unconditional attachment to unity treats difference as a threat to life Makram Ebeid 2003 and the sectarian wave fears of group identity extinction by assimilation Khan - The Great Partition sectarian identities become seklf reinforcing once tied to political, social, economic good 21st century emergence of sunni victim identity tedency for regimes to securitize identities that treat them as foreign identities shias as iranian fourth pillars as examples iraq - 2003-2008 shia centraic statebuilding Bouillion et al - Iraq: Preventing Another Generation of Conflict vacauum of statea empowers sectarian entrepeurs Blaydes - State of Repression shia cleric @ independence called for half of cabinet seats to be reserved for shias muhsin abu-tbikh and abd al-karim al-uzri all emphasized the shia minority identity 1990&rsquo;s opposition in exile was dominated by Kurdish ethno-nationalism and shia-sect centrism declaration of the shia in iraq post 2015 diminishing relevance of sectarian identity less conflation of shia == iran 2 cycles 03-05 - entrenchment 05-07 - war 08-10 - retreat 11-12 - entrenchment 13-15 - war 16-18 - retreat shia symbols have become banal in the modern age muhasasa 2005 elections were was sect census Harmes: Political Marketing in Post Conflict Elections islamic state (is/isis/isil) forced an ambivilant sunni political actors to align with the state khamis al-khajar shia politicians now has as much to fear from shia public shift from sect to class Conclusion sectarianism stigmatizes real greviances based on class and ethnic lines sects are often more accomodating than non-sectarian countries &ldquo;sectarianism&rdquo; is often instrumentalized each part of sectarianism requires a different theory `}),e.add({id:655,href:"/posts/hadi_al_ameri/",title:"hadi al-ameri",content:`Tags: people, iraq

Talks about the nationalist power of Ottoman narratives, especially in light of places like Albania, Macedonia, etc.
Concludes with that the idea of &lsquo;Ottoman ruins&rsquo; and &lsquo;countries emerging from the ruins&rsquo; is fundalmentally flawed, there is more for the past to teach us
Making Ottoman synonmyous with Islamic or Turkish influences is a defining hallmark of the 19th century Balkan nationalist projects that perceived the Ottoman Empire as a &lsquo;religiously, socially, and institutionally alien imposition on autochthonous Christian medieval socities. - pg 717
The conflation of &lsquo;Turk&rsquo;, &lsquo;Mohammedan&rsquo;, and &lsquo;Muslim&rsquo; helps to stigmatize by lumping diverse &lsquo;Islam&rsquo; into a generalized set of cultural characterists Does the Turkish gov&rsquo;s usage of Ottomanism help spur this idea? Like described in Danforth: The Ottoman Empire from 1923 to Today Influencial public figures in modern Serbia helped reproduce images of converts to Islam as traitors - pg 718 Balkan nations defined themselves against the Ottoman background The Balkan idea puts a lot of stress on the &lsquo;Muslim vs Christian&rsquo; tension Overshadows other communities, such as those described by Blumi - Ottoman Refugees, 1878-1939 Later Bosian Muslims romanticized the Ottoman period as a way to reclaim Bosnia Mulsim cultural traditions while inserting them within the Austro-Hungarian and Yugoslav political frameworks - pg 724 Backfires, this self-justifying stance provided the Serbs and Croats a way out, stating that the Ottoman past and legacy were solely shared by the Bosnians Bosnian reclamation of the Ottoman heritage is atypical when compared to mustafa kemal Bosnian version is very romanticized and valoried Questions:
Are these nationalism made stronger due to the assimlation of religion and being co-opted by the state, described by Anscombe - State, Faith, and Nation? `}),e.add({id:661,href:"/posts/halevi_modern_things_on_trial/",title:"Halevi - Modern Things on Trial",content:`books, islam

Essay Intro Shia rituals during Muharram are performed in the public, often accompainying cries of passion and various acts, such as beatings of the chest (latm), reciting elegies of martyrs during the events of Karbala (majilis al-aza), back flagellation (zangeel), head laceration (tatbir), reenactment of Hussein&rsquo;s death (taziyeh), and. An oft heard refrain within elegies and lamations is &ldquo;Every day is Ashura, every land is Karbala&rdquo;, bridging the current time with the events of Karbala. Other forms, such as &ldquo;Ya laytana kunna ma&rsquo;akum fa&rsquo;nafuzu fawzan &rsquo;eziman!&rdquo; (Oh how we wish we had been with you, we would have won a glorious victory) [cite: Edith Szanto].
The month of Muharram, especially with the tenth day of Ashura, remains holy for Shias. The month proceeds in three stages: rituals begin around the third of Muharram to the ninth, with the tenth day of Ashura commemorating the death of Imam Hussein. Three days later is burial day (&ldquo;yom al dawm&rdquo;), where commemorates the actual burial of Imam Hussein. Forty days after the beginning of Muharram is an event called Arbaeen, a day of commemoration often accompinied by the pilgrimage to Karbala from various cities around the world.
Latm often accompanies the recitement of elegies, with most performative elegies following one of three common tempos [cite: fieldnotes, interview with radood]. Each tempo is accompanied with latm at different rates, with the reciter, known as a radood, leading the audience. This practice is often inclusive of the audience both vocally and physically, participants chant refrains while beating their chests, with the radood often inviting audiences to particpate with occasional interjections of &ldquo;yallah shabab!&rdquo; [cite: fieldnotes].
While latm is a relatively accepted practice withinby the Shia Ulema of Karbala or Najaf, zangeel and tatbir have been points of contention, with different jurists proclaiming whether the practices are permissible, discouraged, or forbidden. New variations to practices have been introduced over time, inciting debate within the ulema on what particular practices are correct. Zangeel has been described as having been introduced by the British governor of Najaf during the mandate period, tatbir has been called a foriegn Iranian import. Since 2010 in Iraq, a pratice known as al-Shur, where rather than chanting &ldquo;Hussein-Hussein&rdquo;, a shortened form of the name is chanted instead with &ldquo;sin-sin&rdquo;.
This paper will step away from questions of authenticity and origin of practice, as scholars such as Werner Ende [cite ende] and Yitzhak Nakash [cite nakash] have already provided excellent work on this topic. Rather, I will attempt to describe some of the tools jurists and religious leaders use while engaging in the categorization of rituals. In other words, this paper attempts to provide the backgrounds to two questions: 1. what is mutable within Iraqi Shi&rsquo;i religious rituals, and what is not? and 2: How do participants, ulema, and state engage with ritual change? I do this by starting with Sayyid Amin, a 20th century Damascus sheikh who set off a firestorm of debate by publishing a tract that forbids tatzir. By attempting to complicate the story previously written by Max Weiss, I show that the process of practice categorization is not a mere debate between sectarian practices or an arena of engagement between ulema and participants, but rather that the discursive process of categorization is used as a way to reduce temporal estrangement and envision a different future.
I first attempt to set out the definitions of ritual and ritual practices under assessment, then describe the previous work done by Max Weiss, Werner Ende, Yitzhak Nakash, and Edith Szanto have conducted on these rituals. Next, I describe the historical facts under consideration, describing Sayyid Amin and his contemporaries in their debate on zangeel and tatzir. Finally, I describe how not only do the literal ritual practices attempt to reconnect different conceptions of temporalities, but the process of ritual categorization does as well.
What is a ritual? Rituals have been richly studied from the a variety of perspectives, from the anthropological [cite: Turner], to the religious [cite: Gelser], to tourism [cite: Shackley, 2001]. Research has focused on issues such as the institutions responsible for pilgrimage, to internal and external motivations of pilgrims, to the spiritual marketplace of rituals, where symbols and objects take on new semantic meaning and begin to flow in the economy of authenticity. Authenticity is perhaps the most important of these, as authenticity serves as the key driver to the moment of anagnorisis, evoking a feeling of &lsquo;rapture&rsquo; or &rsquo;exhalation&rsquo; [cite: Moufahim].
For the purposes of this paper, I will riff off of Judith Butler&rsquo;s understanding of rituals, which themselves build off of Derrida&rsquo;s interpreation of the performative. A ritual is a practice whose recursive iteration produces the social norms and serve to simulatnously constrain and enact one&rsquo;s agency. One must buy into social norms to have agency, but in buying into a particular set of norms inherently limits the acts performed. In looking at rituals through labor of iteration, it becomes clear that the regulation of such labor is key to the continuing survival of social norms. In other words: if rituals are constitutive of social norms via the labor of iteration, the labor must be appropriately managed in order to continue social norms.
In addition, I categorize the Muharram rituals as a pilgrimage as well as a ritual. Muharram rituals are not practiced at whim, their activation requires a specific combination of places, people, props, and time. Tents and space must be found for the majilis, props and swords must be avaiable for the acts of self flagellation, and ritual practioners arrive from a variety of places. While many of their travels during Muharram may be shorter in physical distance than either Hajj or pilgrimage to Hadrawmaut, the structure remains the same: one cannot practice tatbir by themselves, and must be within a particular space in order to practice.
The concept of authenticity is particularly bound up to the guidence of ritual continuation, as it underpins the notion that rituals are transformative. The rituals of Muharram are subject to a variety of frictions for the practicer, from the physical pain of the rituals to arrival at the ritual site to iteractions of different sect and backgrounds. Coleman suggests that pilgrimage serves as a cite of stabilizing meaning through connections, the arrival of ritual practicers, from a variety of backgrounds, creates differences in understanding [cite Coleman, S. 2014. Pilgrimage as Trope for an Anthropology of Christianity. Current Anthropology 55, S10: S281–S291]. The effort of smoothing the rocky terrain of variegated understandings is placed on the ritual leader, which is either the radood or sheikh leading the rituals or the ulema that attempt to set out guidelines for rituals.
Shia Rituals Mourning rituals, within the context of this paper, refers to the rituals Shia muslims practice after the loss of someone dear to the individual. This includes crying, chest beating, and celebrating the anniversary of death and accomplishments. The rituals of Muharram for Imam Hussein are a subset of mourning rituals, but considered the most venerated of them.
The rituals of Muharram revolve around three main days: Ashura, Burial Day, and Arbaeen. Rituals that revolve around Ashura typically begin around the third day of muharram, commemorating the anniversary of Imam Hussein&rsquo;s martyrdom, the martyrdom his seventy-two family members, as well those of their followers. The word &ldquo;Ashura&rdquo; refers to the tenth day, as it is stated that Imam Hussein died on the tenth day of Muharram, and his body stayed fresh for three days before he was buried by the women of his tribe.
Specifically, the rituals of Ashura involve majilis al-aza (mourning councils), in which readers recite elegies about the various martyrs and events of Karbala. In my fieldwork, I have witnessed only two types of majilis, although both types may occur, one after the other, within the same majilis. The first is one where attendants sit arrayed around a religious leader referred to as either khateeb or sheikh, who recites a lamentation poetry referred to as niyahah. This type of majilis often involves only verbal engagement with the audience, with the religious leader often pausing to allow the attendees to wail or interject with shouts of mourning. The second type of majilis is one where the audience gathers around a religious bard, called a radood, reciting a mourning poem called a qasida. The radood recites a story of martyrdom, often times either with a rythm provided from instruments or beatings of the chest, called latmiya. The engagement with the audience here is much more intense, when majilis transition from a religious leader to a radood, the audience separates themselves into those willing to engage with sustained, powerful strikes to their chest and those willing to sit around, engaging passively. Nevertheless, the enagement with the audience here is more much intense and sustained than the first type of majilis.
Another ritual that accompanies Ashura and Burial Day is the practice of tatbir, or head lacerations. This practice often begins as sunrise on Ashura, where participants gather in white robes and shaved heads to strike their heads with a sword, causing bleeding. These are often accompanied by arrays of fellow worshippers who pass bags of ice for wound cleanup, as well as those who wish to simply wish to witness the act. It is no doubt that the practioners of tatbir are aware of the shock value of their act, Edith Szanto mentions that &ldquo;few of the women who knew me proudly pointed out their male relatives who were performing tatbir.&rdquo; [cite: szanto]
For the purposes of this paper, the rituals of Arbaeen are ignored, as they are not under fiqh contention with the scholars. However, within the greater context of Iraq, Arabeen rituals are largely centered around the physical walking to Karbala from another city.
Sayyid Muhsin al-Amin al-Amili Sayyid Muhsin al-Amin al-Amili (d. 1952) was the highest ranked jurist in Damascus in the 1920&rsquo;s when he published a tract condemming bloody acts of self flagellatoin [cite: szanto, ende, weiss]. This proceeded to set off a firestorm of debate, which Werner Ende referred to as &ldquo;the great Shia fitna&rdquo; and what Max Weiss calls &ldquo;The Ashura Debates&rdquo;. Born in 1867/1868 and after acquiring his marjia&rsquo; status from Najaf, al-Amin proceeded to publish a five part work called al-majalis al-saniya [cite: ende, weiss]. Notably, this work suggested &ldquo;purging unsound sources or inaccurate accounts, proscribing certain practices as well as calling for a deeper awareness not only among Shi‘i ‘ulama’, but also among lay believers, of the social and political ramifications of engaging in such cultural practices in the first place&rdquo; [cite: weiss, 76].
His main opponents were Sheikh Abd al-Husan Sadiq of Nabatiya (d. 1942) and Sayyid Muhammad al-Husain al-Kashif al-Ghita&rsquo; (d. 1954) an Iraqi Shi&rsquo;i mujtahid. As both Max Weiss and Werner Ende step through the step by step responses, I will not rewrite them here. Instead, I wish to highlight a few notable facts about this case: al-Amin attempted to only remove a certain set of practices, such as tatbir and latimya, that he deemed would spoil the image of Shi&rsquo;ism [cite: ende 26, weiss ?], al-Amin was not the first to attempt to purge such practices [cite: ende, 26], al-Amin points out that flagellation was unknown to the Shia community at the time of the Buyids [cite: ende 27].
The interest in the preservation of the image of Shi&rsquo;ism by al-Amin by reforming a specific subset of practices hints at the the priorities at stake. Why was tatbir considered worse to the image of Shi&rsquo;ism than elegies? Why is crying to niyahah considered just as bad for the image of Shi&rsquo;ism than latmiya listening to a radood? It is notable that al-Amin was not the only one at the time who attempted to reform certain practices, Werner Ende finds that Sayyid Abu l-Hasan al-Isfahani (d. 1946), the supreme mujtahid of Najaf at the time, and Sayyid Muhammad Mahdi al-Qazini (d. 1939), another prominent Iraqi Shia cleric based in Basra, both issued fatawa attempting to exclude what they saw as wrong and harmful practices [cite: Hamdan, 72, Ende, 26]. Weiss attributes this fear of poor image to others as a modern sense of sanctity of the individual body [cite: weiss, 80], finding that al-Amin hides an universalitic impulse: the human body is sanctified, either as Shi&rsquo;i or non-Shi&rsquo;i, and an &ldquo;an attempt to render “traditional” religion palatable to a newly envisioned Shi‘i public, to effectively modernize tradition in the process.&rdquo; [cite: weiss, 81].
While Weiss&rsquo;s reading of the body in al-Amin seems to be a factor, the more overt factor seems to be that making the rituals paletable provides a greater chance of proztelization. In addition, &lsquo;Abd al-Husayn al-Hilli, another Iraqi mujtahid buckets tatbir, latimya, and weeping all into the same bucket [cite: weiss, 85]. Weeping, as a ritual tool, should have seemingly no violation on the individual santicty of the body, and in fact weeping for Hussein was declared as &ldquo;I am the martyr of tears (qatil al-ibrah), no man of faith remembers but that he weeps&rdquo; [cite: Ayoub, 143]

Georgio Agamben&rsquo;s idea of Homo Sacer, a revival of the classical Roman idea of &ldquo;sacer&rdquo; mixes the concepts of &ldquo;sacred&rdquo; and &ldquo;cursed&rdquo;. The concept revolves around state power and biopolitics, but roughly it maps to how certain life cannot be readily sacrified, but can be destroyed without punishment.
However, Agamben always envisioned this as a state of exception within power relations between the central state. An overarching position of power, with the means to enforce violence became the central feature of Agamben&rsquo;s work, ending with his frequent cries about potential camps in Europe.
What if one can become homo sacer through amnesia? Authority must be repeatedly demonstrated by those who have it in order to reinforce authority, in the same way memory must demonstrate itself to not be forgotten.
Iraq has not just been forgotten, the memory has become twisted to the point it&rsquo;s only used to prevent its wholesale sacrifice. Take Rafha camp, a refugee camp constructed by UNHCR in Saudi Arabia after the Gulf War to house Shi&rsquo;as who fled. UNHCR, in their brillance, basically left the Saudi authorities to have free reign on the desert camp. It was only after the invasion did UNHCR negotiate for an extended mandate to repatriate Iraqis beyond the camp itself. More recently, the Baghdad bureaus for two major newspapers have closed, leaving press coverage in a strange state here. In just my years here, I&rsquo;ve noticed a dramatic descrease in journalism presence, which has bound the remaining jouralists to relying more and more on NGO workers as experts and fact builders on the ground.
What this all combines to form is this country as Homo Sacer, Iraqis die, but only die to be used in local politics. International regimes do not speak to Iraqis, they work through statist instutions which are known to be corrupt. The real estate corruption boom is part and partial to this, anyone that has visted 1001 nights in Baghdad, a resort on the banks of Athimiya located within one of Saddam&rsquo;s old palaces, can experience the visible signs of corruption and money laundering. The Hashd al-Shaabi have recently launched their &ldquo;official&rdquo; construction company, which has priority on state contracts.

What is homogenous time? If you take Sara Pursely&rsquo;s book Familiar Futures, homogenous time lies at the core of modern society today . She describes how by the standardization of homogenous time, capitalism, which is predicated upon &ldquo;uniform duration and endless repetition&rdquo;, has evolved. While her frame of analysis is the history of Iraq, I think it&rsquo;s a bit more interesting if we push past a pure historical or even anthropological frame.
&ldquo;Human&rdquo; Time Ibn Khaldun theorized a specific, human-touched notion of time, where civilizations rise in their youth, reach their zenith in their middle ages, then decays as another civilization overtakes it. Pursely describes this as &ldquo;biological time&rdquo; , but Yoav DiCapua described a different take. During 1894-95, following the &lsquo;Urabi revolt, Mahmud Fahmi wrote a book called Al-Bahr al-zākhir fī tārīkh al-\`ālam wa akhbār al-awā´il wa-l-awākhir (The Bottomless Sea on the Events of World History). With a flourish that only 19th century ameture writers could, it claimed to record every piece of human history, from the beginning of time to its writing. While it certainly fell short of this lofty goal, it did proudly declare itself to follow Ibn Khaldun&rsquo;s conception of time, claiming no historical progress, only historical causation .
Benard Anderson introduces to us the idea that a national is constructed by a shared conceptualization of homogenous time. In Imagined Communities, his seminal work on nationalism, he claims that the proliferation of newspapers allows citizens of a singular nation to imagine themselves as part of a greater whole, despite never being able to meet with the majority of their fellow citizens. All newspaper readers (or what he calls print capitalism) perceive at the same time, a day is what was written about in a newspaper. A event that happened on a newspaper dated October 24th occurs for October 24th for all readers who follow the Gregorian calendar1.
Ahmet Hamdi Tanpınar wrote a satire called the &ldquo;The Time Regulation Institute&rdquo;, in which the Turkish government attempts to regulate time by setting up a special ministry. Riffing off of Ataturk&rsquo;s reforms to use the Gregorian calendar in 1926, the book itself is written in a jumbled time.
What Khaldun, Fahmi, and Tanpınar all have in common is this fundamental understanding that time is, and could, be demarcated differently. Given that we&rsquo;re all experiencing time passing at different rates locked in our homes, all of these analyses attempt to wrestle with some conception of history and casualty, from the perception of a human.
&ldquo;Computer&rdquo; Time How long is sleep(16)2, really? Most of the time you could say it&rsquo;s 16 seconds, but most programmers know that&rsquo;s a dirty lie. You have POSIX sleep(), usleep(), nanosleep, and all sorts of other stuff that could be happening underneath. Now most modern CPU&rsquo;s3 have a &ldquo;clock interrupt&rdquo;, where the CPU is halted in order to process tasks that were scheduled, or tasks that need to be done periodically4. Which means that your sleep call is only as granular as the rate of the clock interrupt, if clock interrupts only fire every 32 seconds, ~sleep~ing for 16 does nothing, the OS only checks the tasks you&rsquo;ve scheduled every 32 seconds.
This gets even worse when you bring multiple computers into play. Synchronized, persistent clocks are the end goal for basically all distributed systems5. Most programmers are familiar with NTP, which allows for clock &ldquo;synchronization&rdquo; between multiple computers, using a layered strata. Some clocks exist at stratum 0, which are extremely high precision clocks and the ultimate source of truth, and computers on lower strata derive their information from clocks of higher strata. Yet NTP sync is notoriously bad for some cases, since NTP synchronization is often off by tens of milliseconds. Tens of milliseconds means an awful rate of consistency issues for databases, so clearly something needed to be done.
To understand this a bit more, the concept of linearizability vs serializability need to be introduced6. Linearizability is atomic consistency and C in CAP7, writes happen, and when reads happen, they read the value that was written last. It&rsquo;s important to note that linearizability is about a single operation on a single node.
Serializability is I in ACID8. Serializability guarantees that transactions don&rsquo;t interfere with each other. A partially written transaction on key foo in progress doesn&rsquo;t affect the read of key foo that&rsquo;s also in progress. In a single system, you can achieve this with a monotonically increasing clock, and just take the timestamp of each transaction.
Of course, we live in a world where there are many computers, and many of them are far apart. Clock drift9 is mitigated somewhat with NTP, but like we said before, NTP is far too slow for databases.
So what&rsquo;s to be done? Google&rsquo;s distributed database Spanner uses TrueTime10, which basically exposes the time uncertainty to all the machines. No database machine at Google is ever allowed to be within more than a certain upper bound, which Google says is 7ms. With this guarantee, nodes simply wait 7ms before reporting a transaction is finished. As a result, &ldquo;because all clocks in the system are within 7ms of each other, waiting 7ms means that no subsequent transaction may commit at an earlier timestamp, even if the earlier transaction was committed on a node with a clock which was fast by the maximum 7ms&rdquo;10. This allows Spanner to provide both linearizability and serializability11
Now we can&rsquo;t all be Google and have an army maintaining our systems. Some of us don&rsquo;t have infinite budgets, so we have to make do with some other ways. One way, proposed in the original dynamo paper, is eventual consistency. For example, Cassandra12, which adopts the Dynamo model, can sort-of perform linearizable reads via strict quorum reads13. Eventual consistency, with each node holding its own history and gossiping to each other by comparing transaction logs is a different way of using time than the strong consistency Spanner provides.
Notions of Time What&rsquo;s interesting here is that computers have rehashed the Khaldun/Anderson time divide. Spanner&rsquo;s usage of TrueTime is very Anderson, each machine experiences time along the same scale (with some bounded amount of lag), akin to citizens reading a newspaper (within a fixed amount of days). Dynamo/Cassandra is very Khaldunian, each node experiences time as a cycle. Data for the Dynamo model grows and matures (new writes and gossiping new writes), then dies (via read repairs14). While I don&rsquo;t want to suggest the concept that people are simply distributed systems, I think it&rsquo;s fairly interesting that the same models have arisen out of different needs and different conceptions of time.
The Islamic calendar, or the هجري, is one of the more common impedance mismatches of time today. Iran and Afghanistan still follow the solar version of this calendar. The same with the Chinese calendar, although the PRC has adopted the Gregorian calendar, the shifting date of Chinese New Year due to the lunar calendar is a leftover from when the measurement of time was inconsistent.&#160;&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;

Talks about how the transformation to a more forceful regime for UN peacekeepers has impaired neutrality and possibly foreclosed the humanitarian space
Robustness on paper was only self-defense, but un department of peacekeeping (DPKO) has used it when force was necessary for the mandate of the mission, has therefore become the defacto case that peace enforcement becomes the business of the multinational coalitions authorized by the security council, and not the un
But usage of force comes with problems of being forced to pick sides, and does not necessarily always the right solution. Issues of seeing deployments like the force intervention brigade (FIB), as dual hatting both the force and the aid.
fao and other ngo&rsquo;s (soft underbelly) become possible targets once the UN steps down from its neutral perch, such as when the united nations multidimensional integrated stabilization mission in mali (MINUSMA) was strict on the side of the government, and incorporations of French Units into the MINUSMA umbrella raises the problem that they exist to maintain territorial integrity
same case with united nations multidimensional integrated stabilization mission in the central african republic (MINUSCA)
UN also continues to grapple with issue of state sov when it comes to deploying missions
But is this problem unique? Does the problem that no UN mission actually has a consistnet force policy now mean that enemies no longer have an understanding of how to engage? What about the applications of counterinsurgency?

What is ICS? Used for all kinds of incidents, applicable for all events, not only just for emergencies Establishes common processes for incident level planning Used to manage any type of incident ICS (IS-100) National Incident Management System
- Gives a unified chain of command - Managable span of control - Establishes common terminology Incident Action Planning Managable Span of Control Refers to number of individuals that one supervisor can manage effectively during an incidient Comprehensive Resource Management Entails:
Resource identification Qualification and certification of personnel Planning for resources Acquiring, storing, and inventorying resources Establishment and Trasnfer of the Chain of Command Command function should always be established at the beginning of an incident Transferring command during incidient should include a briefing that captures all essential information Unified Command
Established when there are multiple agencies, where no single jurisdiction exists that has the authority to manage the incident on its own Chain of command
Allows incident comander to direct and control the actions to avoid the incident Q-&gt; snafucatchers? Avoids confusion by requiring that orders flow from supervisors Unity of command
Refers to overall hierarchy of organizational command Each person Reports to one ICS supervisor Recieve work assignments only from the ICS supervisor Prevents confusion based on titles Accountability Multiple principles
Checkin/checkout Incident Action Planning Unity of command Personal responsibility Span of control Resource tracking Five Major ICS functional areas Command Sets incident objectives, strategies, and priorities Operations Conducts operations to reach incident objectives Planning Support by tracking resources, collecting/analyzing info, maintaining documentation Logistics Arranges for resources and needed services to support achievement of the incident objectives Finance/Administration Monitors costs related to the incident Intelligence/Investigations 6th ICS function Used only for intensive intelligence gathering or investigative activity Incident Command Act of directing, ordering, or controlling the incident response ICS uses an incident commander, who has the authoirty to establish objectives, make assignments, and order resources Always staffed in ICS applications Responsible for Ensuring overall incident safety Providing information services Establishing and maintaining liasons May assign deputies that can fully take over the role Should be clearly established at the beginning of an incident Modular, IC should be able to assume other roles Depending on size, 3 additional roles may include Public Information Officer Interfaces with public/media and other agencies Safety Officer Monitors incident operations and advises the IC on all matters relatin g to safety Liaison Officer Serves at the incident commander&rsquo;s point of contact for representitives of gov agencies Incident Coordination Ensure that ICS organization receives the info, resources, and support needed Establishing policy based on interactions with agencies and other stakeholders Collect, analyzing, and disseminating information to support establisment of shared situational awareness Establishes priorities among incidents Resolving critical resource issues Facilitating logistics support &amp; resource tracking Synchronizing public information messages Emergency Operations Center

http://un.org.np/node/11787 https://www.unddr.org/the-iddrs/level-1/ United Nations. “Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration : Report of the Secretary-General,” 2006. https://digitallibrary.un.org/record/571084?ln=en. Followed up by the stockholm initatives in ddr Advises everything from collection of data to ensuring the national ownership of the DDR.
Specific Definitions Disarmament Disarmament is the collection, documentation, control and disposal of small arms, ammunition, explosives and light and heavy weapons of combatants and often also of the civilian population. Disarmament also includes the development of responsible arms management programmes.
Demobilization Demobilization is the formal and controlled discharge of active combatants from armed forces or other armed groups. The first stage of demobilization may extend from the processing of individual combatants in temporary centres to the massing of troops in camps designated for this purpose (cantonment sites, encampments, assembly areas or barracks). The second stage of demobilization encompasses the support package provided to the demobilized, which is called reinsertion.
Reinsertion Reinsertion is the assistance offered to ex-combatants during demobilization but prior to the longer-term process of reintegration. Reinsertion is a form of transitional assistance to help cover the basic needs of ex-combatants and their families and can include transitional safety allowances, food, clothes, shelter, medical services, short-term education, training, employment and tools. While reintegration is a long-term, continuous social and economic process of development, reinsertion is a short-term material and/or financial assistance to meet immediate needs, and can last up to one year. \`
Reintegration Reintegration is the process by which ex-combatants acquire civilian status and gain sustainable employment and income. Reintegration is essentially a social and economic process with an open timeframe, primarily taking place in communities at the local level. It is part of the general development of a country and a national responsibility, and often necessitates long-term external assistance.
Lessons Learned DDR has often been conducted in a fractured manner &ldquo;At best, this has resulted in disjointed programmes with large gaps between the various components. At worst, it has led to disillusioned ex-combatants returning to arms as was the case in Sierra Leone and in Haiti.&rdquo; Narrow focus on short-term security goals has often lead to the exclusion of women and minorities, such as in sierra leone and liberia democratic republic of the congo and burundi failed to account for women DDR cannot be implemented in isolation DDR is contingent on all the political will of parties to the conflict Fragmented approach to DDR within the UN undermines the peace process disarmament and demobilization can be accomplished on a short timespan, reintegration is open ended practionioner based, we must capture all the knowledge previously learned Failure to disarm former combatants and to control weeapons seriously undermines long temr peace Demobilization is multifacted, marks the change of status of a combatant to civilian, requires careful integrated planning, timing, and sequencing Avoid cash benefits for children liberia, payment of 300 transitional safety net had significant negative impact on children Reintegration is open ended and often handed over other development agencies sierra leone, UNAMSIL ended in 2005, but UNDP took over reintegration Ongoing conflicts reintegration support can prevent the rerecruitment of children 5 key points of reintegration Start planning for reintegration ASAP Develop national capacity Situate reintegration within a wider recovery strategy Balance equity and security Ensure a timely transition from supporiting individuals to supporting communities Reintegration benefits must be tailored based on gender, age, educational equalifications and etc Special consideration for demobilized former faction leaders Funding has been a major problem, disarmament and demobilization are easy to fund, where as reintegration is hard to fund and open ended, long funding cycles `}),e.add({id:761,href:"/posts/integrated_information_theory/",title:"integrated information theory",content:`Tags: math, episteme

Lots of people praying, standing, and wiping their stuff onto the Abbas cage
Seems like standing in the middle in reflection while rubbing prayer beads is allowed
What function do the prayer beads serve for Shias?
Saw two shrine staff tell dudes with women (a mother once and a sister another) to move to a different section of the shrine (presumably the women&rsquo;s area)
People are sleeping in the shrine, they are passed out and sleeping
Many children run around
Definitely smells of moving air and feet
Sitting next to a sheikh (?) who said something to me but I didn&rsquo;t respond, and it looks like he&rsquo;s looking at some videos on his phone
Seeing many old women be wheeled around me
Majilis al-3za, March 24th
Little kids playing around
started at 1, currently 1:17, nobody is crying or anything
Seems to be quite back and forth
Are there women&rsquo;s majilis? Or do women see it as a separate thing or streaming?
How long are the majilis usually?
Usual crowd, clustered around the front, scattered in the back
Elicits specific phrases or prayers at times during refrains or something else
Very short, only 30 min, everyone goes to speak with the sheikh afterwards
Looks like they leave the stage up afterwards?
During ashura the majilis was a lot more intense, this one seems to be just very quick and very simple
Sidebar: some youth are reading Quran together, with one receiving and leading the way

In all his discussions, Mr. Qazi has stressed the importance of inclusiveness and achieving a balanced representation in the composition of the Government and in the drafting of the Constitution to ensure that the legitimate interests and concerns of all Iraqis are addressed. Both inside and outside Iraq, my Special Representative and his team met with representatives of Arab Sunni communities, tribes and groups to gain a better understanding of their concerns and intentions with regard to the political process. My Special Representative firmly encouraged them to articulate their views through peaceful participation and dialogue
Possibly conflating &ldquo;federalism&rdquo; and &ldquo;sectarianism&rdquo;?
UNAMI has organized its assistance programme in five distinct areas: facilitation and good offices geared towards promoting inclusiveness and consensusbuilding; institutional support to include material assistance, capacity-building, training and expertise; knowledge-sharing on procedural and substantive subjects, such as the nature of the State, federalism, human rights (including women’s rights), civil service and armed forces; public outreach to include education of media, civil society and communities (

Calls out the issues of a full empowered electoral comission
Recongizes that many fled after the bombing of the Al-Askari shrine
calls for notions of unity
In these difficult times, Iraqi politicians, religious leaders, tribal elders and influential members of civil society must not lose sight of the fundamental goal of preserving Iraq’s national unity. They must work towards settling their differences peacefully and protecting the human dignity of all Iraqis, irrespective of their creed and ethnicity&hellip;Ultimately, the Iraqi people and their leaders face a fundamental choice, between seeking a negotiated political settlement or drawing further into the abyss of sectarian conflict
S/2007/330 Recongizes the issues with Kirkuk and the fact that there is not an effective electoral registry S/2007/608 Special represenitive visited Kirkuk The Special Representative paid close attention to developments relating to the implementation of Article 140 and visited the Kurdistan region on two occasions, from 10 to 12 July and from 16 to 18 September, to consult with senior officials of the Kurdistan regional government.
Notes the fall in violence There is now an opportunity that should not be missed. September witnessed the lowest number of Iraqi casualties for the year. The decrease in violence resulting from the ceasefire by the Mahdi Army and the Sunni insurgent allegiance against Al-Qaida holds significant political potential as well.
S/2008/19 Ashraf Qazi leaves
Failure to implement Article 140, although engagements with the UN:
Perhaps the most encouraging development in Iraq was the readiness recently shown by the top leadership in Baghdad and Arbil to begin to work cooperatively among themselves and with my Special Representative to ensure that tensions relating to the lapse of the deadline in article 140 did not lead to further violence. I now call upon those leaders and their constituents to continue to move along this path with the same statesmanship and spirit of cooperation they have displayed during the most recent discussions. In particular, I invite them to take advantage of the agreed-upon six-month period and the offer of technical assistance from UNAMI and to make progress in deciding the future of some of the disputed territories.

I therefore appeal to Iraq’s diverse communities and their political leaders to continue to work with one another in a spirit of dialogue and grand compromise in a manner that reinforces the overall national interest.
met with grand ayatollahs
During the reporting period he visited Najaf, where he met with several political and religious leaders, including Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani and Grand Ayatollah Fayyad. Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani expressed his appreciation for the work of the United Nations in Iraq and, in particular, the Organization’s efforts in facilitating the negotiations on the provincial election law. My Special Representative also made a visit to Ramadi, highlighting the commitment of the United Nations to the expansion of its presence in Al-Anbar Governorate and the delivery of programmes on the ground throughout Iraq.
S/2009/102 sets up a committee to discuss kirkuk
In this connection, the mission has been working with a parliamentary committee set up according to article 23 of the provincial elections law. The committee was tasked by the Council of Representatives to (a) determine a power-sharing formula before provincial elections are held in the Kirkuk Governorate; (b) assess the issue of property disputes before and after 9 April 2003; and (c) c
Another call for unity, notes about kirkuk
In the coming months, attention is likely to shift towards the issue of disputed internal boundaries and the status of Kirkuk. The groundwork being undertaken by UNAMI with key interlocutors in Baghdad and in the disputed areas remains a priority for the mission. The United Nations is committed to playing an impartial and neutral role towards building confidence and trust among the parties concerned, promoting dialogue and helping to forge a consensus.
S/2009/284 Continued discussion of the article 140 committee Subsequent briefings took place with the relevant parliamentary committees, including the article 23 committee, the article 140 committee and the Constitutional Review Committee.
Ignores the overt toned nature of a sectarian-based federalism
Nevertheless, many important challenges remain, and further progress is needed in the coming months to ensure that the gains made so far can be sustained. As I have said in my previous reports, national reconciliation remains the main priority in Iraq. In particular, the resolution of key issues, including federalism, the sharing of natural resources and disputed internal boundaries, could serve as a means to achieving lasting peace. Further progress on these complex issues will be possible only if Iraqi leaders come together in a spirit of national unity and adopt muchneeded constitutional and legislative measures in the political, electoral, economic and social fields.
acknolwedges rising tensions, but attempts to reconcile this through a &ldquo;spoils of war&rdquo; method, by linking rising tensions to disputed boundaries
I note with concern rising tensions in several areas, particularly in Ninawa, Kirkuk and Diyala. While I welcome the recent effort to organize joint patrols between the Iraqi Security Forces and the Peshmerga in some disputed areas, much more needs to be done to stabilize the situation. I urge national and local leaders to endeavour to ease tensions and work towards resolving the underlying causes. In this regard, I support the efforts of my Special Representative and UNAMI to facilitate a political dialogue and assist the parties in finding mutually acceptable solutions. In particular, the Mission’s report on the disputed internal boundaries of Iraq could serve as a useful starting point for constructive dialogue
S/2009/393 Calls for an end to provactive statements from Kurdistan regional gov and the Iraqi gov as a way of toning down tensions this is good? although ignores the ways that these tensions S/2009/585 Another call for elections as reconcilation
Since 2003, with United Nations assistance, Iraq has managed to hold three successful elections and a national referendum, generally considered credible and broadly participatory. The peaceful conduct of provincial elections and Kurdistan Regional Government elections earlier in 2009, underscores this remarkable achievement. I firmly believe that the forthcoming national election planned for January 2010 represents a historic opportunity for Iraq and a crucial step forward for national reconciliation
Continued calls for engagement of kirkuk
In order to bring political stability and lasting peace to the country, it is essential that the Federal Government in Baghdad and the leadership of the Iraqi Kurdistan region strive to resolve their differences through meaningful dialogue. Continuing disagreements, in particular with respect to disputed internal boundaries and the sharing of the natural resources, will hinder political progress at the national level.
First call for neighbors non-interference (iran?)
The normalization of Iraq’s relations with its neighbours is important for regional stability. Cooperation on a range of issues of mutual concern, including trade, energy, border security and refugees, will be vital to this end. Regional cooperation is a two-way process. Both Iraq and its neighbours will need to engage each other and demonstrate their willingness to listen to each other’s concerns. I also call upon all Member States, and in particular Iraq’s neighbours, to respect Iraq’s sovereignty and to adhere to the principle of non-interference, a fundamental tenet of the Charter of the United Nations.
S/2010/76 Encouraged by workable solutions, but the solutions are ones that break the impasse via divvying up resources
Despite the lengthy negotiations on the Election Law, I was encouraged by the determination and dedication of Iraqi leaders to find workable solutions and compromises. I would like to commend all those involved who worked to finalize the law and keep the electoral timetable on track. In the same spirit, I appeal to all political blocs and leaders to demonstrate true statesmanship during the election campaign, use the mechanisms in place to submit formal complaints, and abide by the final election results once they are certified by the Federal Supreme Court.
S/2010/206 Welcomes the nomination of al-Maliki, zero mention of the rulings by judge medhat I commend all political blocs and their leaders for engaging in a collective process and reaching agreements that appear to have ended the deadlock in the government formation process. The breakthrough represents a major milestone in democratic progress for Iraq and should pave the way for the first peaceful transition between elected governments under full Iraqi sovereignty. I congratulate President Talabani on his re-election, as well as Mr. Al-Nujaifi on his election as Speaker and Messrs. Qusai al-Suhail and Aref Tayfour, on their election as Deputy Speakers. I also welcome the nomination of Mr. al-Maliki as Prime Ministerdesignate.
S/2010/240 Highlights the high level task force between Arab/Kurdish issues re #+begin_quote The high-level task force, a mechanism aimed at fostering dialogue on ArabKurdish relations, continues to focus on resolving outstanding issues concerning areas of mutual interest through the development of confidence-building measures. In its meeting on 7 February, the task force agreed to prioritize the issues of property disputes, detainees and language rights in schools. In particular, it called upon political parties to vacate occupied schools in Kirkuk so that they may be returned to public use. #+end_quote
S/2010/406 Facilitates an Arab-Kurdish dialogue
In a renewed effort to normalize Arab-Kurdish relations in the north, UNAMI supported a government-initiated dialogue process aimed at ending the boycott of the Ninewa Provincial Council and facilitated two meetings between the Ninewa Fraternal list and the Hadba list on 3 April and 15 May, respectively. The discussions focused on security-related issues and the transfer of detainees from Ninewa (currently held in the Kurdistan region), as well as power-sharing with regard to senior posts in the Ninewa Provincial Council.
Mentions of minorities
The Mission also facilitated two further meetings of the newly established Committee on Ethnic and Religious Communities under the Ninewa dialogue process. Participants included representatives of the Christian, Shabak, Turkoman and Yezidi communities, as well as representatives of the Ninewa administration, KRG and the Government of Iraq.
Again calls for national reconciliation and more dialogue
In particular, promoting dialogue and encouraging compromise in disputed areas will greatly contribute to the country’s stability. In this context, I am encouraged by the progress being made in talks assisted by UNAMI to end the impasse over the boycott of the Ninewa Provincial Council by Kurdish parties. An agreement would contribute significantly to easing tensions in the disputed territories and restore confidence insofar as resolving Arab-Kurdish issues at the national level.

`}),e.add({id:803,href:"/posts/post_ottoman_iraq_egypt_irrigation_essay_draft/",title:"Irrigation in Egypt/Iraq Paper",content:`Introduction Massive infrastructure projects within the 20th century have typically been harnessed for nationalistic purposes. While most analysis focuses on the nationalism generating certain types of public works projects, projects constructed under colonial governments and then semi-independent governments reflect much upon the status of a state as well. Irrigation projects in particular are interesting as they are the nexus for a multitude of interests. Dams and irrigation projects may be built to tame natural events such as flooding, used to generate electricity to support a growing population, used as irrigation channels to allow for more productive agriculture. Beyond the technocratic goals, irrigation projects are complex, often requiring outside expertise, and are capital intensive, often requiring the explicit support of the state. As a result, not only does the usage of irrigation projects reflect the goals of the state and the engineers, but the secondary effects such as urbanization, land reform, and the process of construction all refract different interests. Notions rural modernization and the usage of dams as nationalist symbols allows for greater understanding of the nationalist psyche. The kaleidoscope of actors in Egypt and Iraq, from the British colonial powers and the Khedive, to the Young Turks, to the newly created &ldquo;independent&rdquo; states, all sought to realize their visions of the future via irrigation projects.
Viewing irrigation projects holistically allows them to be a useful lens in analyzing how states conceived of the past and the future. The Aswan Low Dam in Egypt, alongside the Hindiya Barrage in Iraq, were both constructed by William Willcocks, and influenced by similar biases. Willcocks, in the construction Aswan Low Dam, sought to manage the expectations and desires of the British public to preserve the Temple of Philae, while simultaneously managing his desires to build grand works that succeeded the Pharaonic era. The debates around the minutiae of the Philae Temple, which captured British public imagination, is a reflection on how the British empire saw itself as a safekeeper of particular points in history.
The Hindiya Barrage, although equated to the Aswan Low Dam in newspapers, was also influenced by Willcock&rsquo;s desires to revive Mesopotamia. The notion that he could revive Eden within ancient lands captured him, so much so that when he retired after the construction of the Hindiya Barrage, he published a book in 1919 entitled From the Garden of Eden to the Valleys of Jordan footcite:ozden_pontifex_2014.
The differences in outcomes of the Aswan Low Dam and the Hindiya barrage arises out of the level of influence the British engineers held over the dams. The engineers of Aswan Low Dam ignored previous attempts at controlling the flow of the Nile footcite:cook_engineering_2013, and built a dam that needed to be raised multiple times, and was the root of the 1942 food shortage . The Hindiya Barrage, on the other hand, was a replacement for a crumbling rubble dam, which meant that there was no opportunity for the engineers to ignore the past. The success of the Hindiya Barrage, fully functional until it was replaced in 1989, is indicative of the value of learning from previous irrigation attempts.
If the Aswan Low Dam and the Hindiya Barrage are reflections of how the British empire saw the states of Egypt and Iraq through primordialism, then irrigation projects post-independence were reflections of a state attempting to build a future that distinguished the rural past and the urban future. The Aswan High Dam, and the urbanization boom of the city of Aswan, was enmeshed with Nasserism&rsquo;s desire to valorize the state. Sealing of the past through both metaphorical and physical means, the Aswan High Dam itself was meant as an example in Egypt.
The Kut Barrage foreshadowed the arrival of American influenced land resettlement projects, such as the failed Dujayla project. While the Dujayla project failed spectacularly, its failures can be traced not only to the influence of American technocrats during the Cold War era, but even further back to the 1933 Law Governing Rights and Duties of Cultivators. This law, which was passed right as the Kut Barrage broke ground in 1934, increased the potential for profits for irrigation pump owners and landholders, incentivizing them to irrigate their lands. As a result, this created a top-down model of irrigation development, which would later lead to the failure of the Dujayla project.
Ultimately, these four irrigation projects can be separated into two distinct periods. Irrigation projects before the fall of the Ottoman Empire were symbols looking towards the past, reflecting primordialist tendencies. The oversight of British engineers on these projects, combined with the relative free-hand given to them by the British government and the Young Turks, allowed for the construction of irrigation projects whose builders believed they were succeeding an ancient legacy. Irrigation projects following independence, in contrast, were nationalist symbols of the future, sealing away the past while it promised an urban future with a remade rural class.
The Aswan Low Dam and the Hindiya Barrage The building of the Aswan Low Dam and the Hindiya Barrage were both born out of the same primordialist tendencies. Technocratic desires for a more agriculturally productive Egypt provided British engineers a chance to impact Egyptian history, marking the birth and development of the Aswan Low Dam. Specifically, the discussion and framing of the Aswan Low Dam were centered around the dreams of British engineers to succeed the developments of the Pharaonic era. Eventually, as the work of Timothy Mitchell and others have shown, this type of top-down development, with a focus on the past and ancient civilizations rather than the realistic needs of the inhabitants would lead to disastrous results for the Aswan Low Dam. In contrast, the Hindiya Barrage was far more successful, particularly because it managed to shy away from the same type of development.
Constructed between 1899 and 1902 and designed by Sir William Willcocks, the Aswan Low Dam was intended to manage the seasonal flooding of the Nile. Notably, the desire to increase cotton production in Egypt was a primary driver of the construction footcite:noauthor_power_1913. Foreign import bans of cotton, alongside massive foreign capital and financial investment made the Egyptian cotton economy extremely developed, despite a complete lack of more industrialized forms of farming footcite:hansen_egypt_1975. This lack of industrial productivity, coupled with the large population, formed the impetus for the Aswan Low Dam.
However, one curiosity seized the feelings of the public: the Temple of Philae. A culturally relevant temple located on a small island within the Nile, the temple of Philae was immediately tied to the Aswan Low Dam. The building of the dam would create a reservoir behind it, threatening to submerge the temple itself. Thus, debates on the height of the Aswan Low Dam were thrust into the public sphere, with discourse eventually reaching to Winston Churchill, who wrote a letter to Willcocks that &ldquo;expressed the sentiments of the public on the lowering of the [Aswan Low] dam to save the Philae temple from annual immersion&rdquo; . Willcocks further points out &ldquo;the height of the dam and the vexed question of the Philae temple&rdquo; , noting the question of the temple drew multitudes of opinions, from &ldquo;savants and antiquaries, many who were not savants and antiquaries&rsquo;&rsquo; as well as the international commission within Egypt, alongside the Egyptian government itself . The agreed upon solution was to place the dam at a height that would leave the temple partially submerged.
However, demand for additional water caused the Aswan Low Dam to be raised by 5 meters in 1910-1912, and another 9 meters was added between 1930-1933. Willcocks would later critique the raisings of the dam in 1919 stating that the insufficient water supply invited further problems footcite:cook_engineering_2013.
In a lecture at the Khedivial geographical dedicated to reviewing the Aswan Low Dam in 1904, Willcocks shows no hesitation in mixing historical references alongside his technical work. He repeatedly cites the importance of his work with irrigation regulators in conjunction with historical references about Joseph&rsquo;s arrival in Egypt . A sizable chunk of this lecture is dedicated to a recollection of history around Joseph, Egyptian pharaohs, and Theban kings, before returning to abruptly lurching back to statistics about the cultivable area surrounding Lake Morris. Curiously, the lecture itself spends little time dwelling on the current residents of the Aswan Low Dam or of Lake Moeris.
Why did the British public, all the way up a member of parliament, express concern about an Egyptian temple thousands of miles away, built as part of an irrigation project meant to maximize the output of Egyptian cotton? Why did Willcocks flit between history and statistics within his lecture? A dam born out of a sheer economic desire had its economic impacts dulled by cultural desires, in an era not especially noted for its concerns. At its core, the primordialist conceptions of Egyptian history lay at the root of these questions.
For Egypt, the temple of Philae is a rallying point for British primordialism, since it is assumed that the Egyptians in the early 1900&rsquo;s are derivatives of the ancient pharaonic civilizations. The lack of references to the Egyptians inhabiting the areas around the Aswan Low Dam are simply fait accompli, and require no consideration. Willcocks himself never denies the necessity of the preservation of the Philae temple, he merely takes offense at the idea that he had not constructed an adequate preservation mechanism vis-a-vis a lower dam height. If the Egyptian past is set in stone as a pharaonic civilization, the role of the British is to birth a future via statistics and development projects. From the British perspective, the Egyptians were not worth mentioning because they had no agency, as they existed merely as a line between the two dots of pharaonic history and British guided techno-politics. This notion had significant buy in from the public as well, demonstrating their concern for a temple thousands of miles away.
Ignoring the local needs and patterns of the local Egyptians lead to disastrous results. Willcocks foreshadows problems with the insufficient water supply upon reflection 17 years later, but the major problem was the lack of foresight on the Nile flooding patterns. By damming the Nile, only one-fifth of the former plains continued to be naturally fertilized via silt deposits. The other four-fifths required fertilizer, with 80 percent of the Egyptian supply controlled by an international cartel. The 1942 food shortage was directly caused by this realignment to using fertilizer, as fertilizer supplies became constrained when war broke out, inducing large numbers of casualties due to food supplies and a malaria epidemic .
In 1875, Midhat Pasha, the Vali of Baghdad, decided to close the Saklawia Canal on account of its gradual decay to become unnavigable footcite:great_britain_iraq_2014. However, as a result of its closing, approximately 750 cubic meters of water per second flooded into the main Euphrates river, exacerbating the seasonal floods from March to May. Further downstream, where the Euphrates splits into two branches, the Hindiya and Hilla, began to experience sentiment deposit issues. As the eastern-facing Hilla branch lay on higher ground than the western-facing Hindiya branch, extra water diverted from the Saklawia Canal caused additional sentiment deposit at the river juncture, threatening to clog the Hilla branch and rendering it unusable. As this area was fertile ground for date palms footcite:money_hindiya_1917, the Ottoman Government decided to build a rubble dam across the Hindiya branch in order to divert more water flow towards the Hilla branch. However, in 1908, the state of the rubble dam had decayed to the point where the Ottoman government solicited outside advice.
Flush off of his success in the Aswan Low Dam, William Willcocks was hired in light of the Young Turk large public work programs footcite:money_hindiya_1917. Utilizing the staff he built during his years in Egypt, Willcocks constructed a new Hindiya barrage, creating two artificial lakes for the excess water: lake Habbaniya and Lake Abu Dilis. Willcocks brought alongside the same notions he had of the Aswan Low Dam, with the same keen interest in history. His book, the Recreation of Chaldea, paints a picture of grand irrigation works from Nebuchadnezzar to Persian kings footcite:ozden_pontifex_2014. With the Hindiya Barrage imagined as the equivalent of the Aswan Low Dam, Willocks approached the Hindiya Barrage with the same mixture of primordial belief about civilization in Iraq as he had in Egypt.
Evaluations of the Hindiya barrage paint it in an exceedingly glowing light, similar to the evaluations of the Aswan Low Dam. Royal Naval handbooks claim the Hindiya barrage is the &ldquo;first great modern work&rdquo; within Iraq footcite:great_britain_iraq_2014 pg 434, placing it alongside the Kut Barrage and the Diyala weir. Malaria had almost completely been eliminated as a side effect of the additional flowing water footcite:officials_introduction_1946-1, and the barrage saw continual usage until 1989 footcite:bin_huwaidin_chinas_2002.
Ultimately, the reason why the Hindiya Barrage was far more successful than the Aswan Low Dam in achieving its goals was that Hindiya Barrage was built off of an existing need. Even though both irrigation projects were considered to be equivalent by the British public footcite:ozden_pontifex_2014 and were built from the same primordialist biases, the previous existence of the old rubble dam constructed by the Ottoman government meant that the needs of the local inhabitants were already built into the Hindiya Barrage project. Rather than attempting to fit the desires of the archaeologists, the British public, and a whole host of other desires, the Hindiya Barrage was more focused on simply creating a functional replacement for the rubble dam, making it far more successful in its goals.
The Aswan High Dam and the Kut Barrage The construction of the Tennessee Valley Authority provided a model that was emulated across the world footcite:biswas_development_2001. These dams served dual roles, simultaneously serving as nationalist symbols while also sources for state building via the separation of the urban and the rural. In particular, the development of the Aswan High Dam and the construction boom in the city of Aswan in Egypt fused with Nasserism&rsquo;s idiosyncrasies to help legitimize the state, while the Kut Barrage and the Dujayla Land project helped exacerbate an urban/rural divide.
Dams within Egypt took on a strict political light following 1956. The nationalization of the Suez Canal, supposedly for the purposes of replacing World Bank loans for the construction of dams footcite:reynolds_city_2017, signaled a shift from rooting development projects in ancient civilizations to rooting them in American technocratic ideals. It was believed that the adoption of American models would transform practices that had formed during the colonial period and set nations upon a more self-sufficient path.
The Aswan High Dam was one of the first major projects of this new era. First proposed by Gamal Abdul Nasser and born out of Cold War dynamics, the literature surrounding the Aswan High Dam is invariably tainted with political motives. Originally due to be funded by the United States, Nasser&rsquo;s alliance with India in forming the non-aligned movement caused the United States to withdraw funding, prompting the Soviet Union to step in in 1959. This has politicized discussions around the Aswan High Dam, to a point where there are significant communities around anti-dam and pro-dam developments.
Yoav DiCapua describes Nasserism and its associated projects as having &ldquo;a constant need for public demonstration of its achievements. It was exhibitionist&rdquo; . In line with this, not only was the lake created by the dam named after Nasser, the Aswan High Dam also aimed to achieve a massive set of goals: from &ldquo;full control of the Nile south of the Aswan&rdquo;, to &ldquo;generalization of cheap and clean hydroelectric power&rdquo;, along with changing the then-current system of basin irrigation to perennial irrigation allowing for two crops a year footcite:abu-zeid_egypts_1997. The famed singer Abdel Halim Hafez composed a song called &ldquo;The High Dam &lsquo;&rsquo;, which was broadcasted across Egypt on state-run channels footcite:reynolds_city_2017. The complete absorption of the Aswan High Dam into popular culture simultaneously legitimized the Egyptian regime, even as the dam was financed and designed by the Soviet Union. The creation of Lake Nasser provides a de facto boundary between Egypt and Sudan, both physically and metaphorically representing a break from the Anglo-Egyptian condominium over Sudan.
At the same time as the construction of the dam, the city of Aswan grew at a frenetic pace between 1950 and 1960 footcite:reynolds_city_2017. The explosion of new housing settlements to accommodate construction workers led to a massive population boom. State funded roads and tourist centers, and an active page of archeological excavation lead to a steady stream of students and tourists in the summer months. The Nubian Museum and the Aga Khan mausoleum accompanied these developments, and helped to root the city of Aswan and the Aswan High Dam both in the national psyche footcite:reynolds_city_2017.
The development of the city of Aswan and the Aswan High Dam were departures from the construction of the Aswan Low Dam. While the Aswan Low Dam was thought by the British to spiritually succeed ancient Egypt, the excavations and museums marked the opposite. Construction of museums and placing them for the view of tourists allows for the clean definition of what is considered &ldquo;the past&rdquo;. The towering structure of the Aswan High Dam, compared to the neatly catalogued historical artifacts within museums, provides for a potent nationalist symbol. Egypt was no longer hoped to relive the glory days of the past, but rather had sealed and left it behind while constructing a new future. Even colonial legacies, such as the Anglo-Egytpian condominium over Sudan, which ended in 1956, were to be neatly delineated by Lake Nasser. Through the active role the state played in the construction of the dam, as well as the &ldquo;exebehitionist&rdquo; tendencies of Nasserism, the state was able to tie its popularity to the popularity of the dam.
Maturation under the Iraqi state fell along similar lines as well. At the start of the Cold War, American style influences, especially molded after the notions of independence and self sufficiency began to take hold, beginning with the Dujayla land project . However, these notions did not come from a strictly Cold War perspective, but rather had their roots in the construction of the Kut Barrage, which started in 1934 and completed in 1939. While specific features of the Dujayla land project would be molded by UN institutions with heavy American influence, ideas about self sufficiency along the Tigris would be seeded with the Kut Barrage.
Originally proposed by William Willcocks during the construction of the Hindiya Barrage as a counterpart on the Tigris, the Kut Barrage remains the oldest continually functioning barrage along a main river in Iraq footcite:abdullah_water_nodate-1. At the time, the ancient canal of Shatt al-Gharraf, which links the cities of Kut and Nasiriyah, had flooding issues, preventing the vast tracts of land alongside the canal from being used for farming footcite:noauthor_kut_1939. Described as returning the canal to &ldquo;the course of the main Tigris channel during the Islamic Era more than 1,000 years ago&rdquo; by a journalist footcite:podsiadlo_tigris_1966, the barrage was completed in 1939, with the intention of supporting larger land reform projects in the future. At the start of the Cold War, the Dujayla land project was one of them.
While the birth of the Kut Barrage began with William Willcocks, the 1933 Law Governing the Rights and Duties of Cultivators was the cornerstone. Previously, a patchwork of Ottoman-era land laws divided land types into three different classifications, mostly held within the hands of the tribal sheikhs and urban landlords. However, following the 1933 Law, land ownership was extended to irrigation pump owners in the case of default by the land cultivators footcite:kiyotaki_ottoman_2019. In addition, the &ldquo;law granted pump owners, lazma holders, and leaseholders full rights over decisions relating to production, including the choice of crops, choice of seeds (kinds and hybrids), water supply, harvesting, marketing, as well as the hiring of outside labor&rdquo; footcite:haj_making_1997. This meant that, once the Kut Barrage was finished and the Shatt al-Gharraf irrigated, the subsequent pump owners, who were mostly wealthy and urban , along the Shatt al-Gharraf would hold significant power over the peasants of the newly irrigated land.
Ultimately, this type of reform exacerbated the rural/urban divide and helped to drive land resettlement projects. The ambition of these land resettlement programs reflect the socioeconomic state of Iraq, which had experienced significant budget surpluses due to increased oil revenues footcite:adams_pre-revolutionary_1963-1. Top down modernization schemes were devised, such as those used in the Dujayla land project, and were largely driven by foreign and international expertise . The notion that the rural peasants desperately needed to be modernized stemmed from land reform laws, which reduced the agency of the rural peasants. This made it such that, when viewed from a foreign perspective, the rural peasants were uneducated and needed teaching, when in fact they were shackled under a series of complex land reform laws. In addition, pump owners and landowners sought to make large capital gains from increases in the value of the land through irrigation schemes . This combination of a foreign conception that rural peasants were undereducated and unaware of their needs, together with a class that desired higher returns on their land via foriegn investment created the conditions for failure in the Dujayla project.
These new attempts at remaking the rural class speak to the desires of the Iraqi state, and the gestation for these projects began with the Kut Barrage. The significance of this is born out by the opening of the Kut Barrage, the last public event King Ghazi of Iraq attended before his death. Speaking to how his father held an interest in the barrage footcite:noauthor_king_nodate, this event would occur again over eighty years later, with President Barham Salih&rsquo;s visit footcite:masum_president_nodate. These visits speak to the barrage&rsquo;s symbolic value for the future, with both heads of state visiting only a few years after significant political turmoil.
The similarities between the Kut Barrage and the Dujayla land project to the Aswan Low Dam and its aftereffects are notable. Both projects were driven in an explicit top-down model that favored ideals over realities on the ground. The failure of the Dujayla project lay in the salinization and outbreak of disease, both of which were determined and understood in the early years by UN technocrats . Despite early warnings, the desire for a cohesive family unit that was self sustaining prevented project workers from intervening. As a result, the Dujayla land project collapsed only a few years later. Likewise, issues with raising the Aswan Low Dam were foreseen by Willcocks in 1919 footcite:cook_engineering_2013. In undervaluing the historical experiences, both imperial narratives from the British and technocratic narratives from the US lead UN process would cause both projects to fall apart.
Conclusion Irrigation provides a dearth of knowledge, and provides a useful lens for the evaluation of nationalism. The massive capital needs draw upon a diverse set of individuals that reflect many aspects of the ruling state, from the politicians to the engineers. The secondary effects of dams, hand-in-hand with the secondary effects of a massive capital injection, shows us how these ideas are reflected on the ground, and provides a testing ground for the durability of nationalism. The development of the Aswan Low Dam and the Hindiya Barrage, the two &ldquo;great works&rdquo; of irrigation that occured at near the turn of the century, shows the devastating effects of primordial and orientalist biases if not tempered by historical experience. The Aswan High Dam and the Kut Barrage provide an insight to how the state used these large infrastructure projects to memorialize the past and shape the future. Irrigation projects are useful case studies in understanding how disparate groups of technocrats, aristocrats, and citizens affect and interpret state driven modernization.

hadd punishment and the property punishment freedom owns property, free woman owns her own body minimum and equitable dower sexuality for women is similar between free or enslaved the commodity of sexuality can be misappropriated thus a free woman is the owner of her sexuality, so payment should go to her coercieve zina and property crime (transgression against crime and transgression against property crime) baber johnansen private ownership of property is central to islamic law does private property underpin rape laws? kiesha ali zakat and personal wealth? manaf3 - capacity, usufroctory benefit anything can have manaf3 zina is diametrically opposed to marital sex divine claims are more important than personal claims however, if the woman did not consent to zina, and the satisfaction of the god and satisfaction of the person are not mututally exclusive the intertwining of the divine claims and personal ones Hanafi approach - single penalty
hanafis believe the manaf3 of people are not mal, they are only rendered manaf3 under a contract generally propriatary view of sexuality marriage requires an exchange value, difference is that the hanafi school does not have the &ldquo;proprietary notion of subjectivity&rdquo; linguistic point - never use istihab hadd only punishment for coercive zina &ldquo;similar to double jepoardy&rdquo; - can&rsquo;t have two punishments for one crime, you have to identify which crime you want to prosecture hadd (crime against god) and mahr (possibly licit sex) means that you have to understand the mahr whether it&rsquo;s licit or illicit, the volition of the human subject has no meaning raises the questions of the dower in coercive zina zina can&rsquo;t be the basis of trade for dower, because then it&rsquo;s similar to paying for dower coercive zina provokes divine and interpersonal claims extremely little interest in the violition of the women central argument - hadd and sadaq (dower) are incompatible dower vs dowery dower - payment that is given by the husband to the wife could you pay sadaq retroactively? underage boy and older woman
underage boy is different because he has not developed sexually (very minority position) understanding of consent is fundalmentally different for a woman than a man do hanafi judges primarily ask themselves the question on the licitness of the sexual act, whereas maliki school asks whether the source of the payment
ta&rsquo;zir - is there punishment for the violence to her
if the payment is the same as the payment for marriage, is there a fine? 5-6 athar and jurisprudence hanafis tried to avoid hadd at all costs, while the malikis didn&rsquo;t however, a distcintion must be made between the plaintiff and the witnesses four adult men and witnesses (quranic), and no compulsion within the hanafi school to witness no way to pursue rape charges without zina largely a crime against god alone were all cases of aversion to hadd, was there differentiation? social values cannot be read off of these legal categories why is punishment greater for a woman who&rsquo;s been married sunni law - if a woman&rsquo;s ever had licit sex, then any sex afterwards is illicit why are slave punishments set at half? their legal status? they have diminished agency formally, there is a hadith concept of shibha - how did this evolve over time? maliki&rsquo;s accept pregenacy as circumstantal evidence allows victims to enter into court against the assailant what could prove compensation 3luq - at least two eyewitnesses divergence between maliki jurists and hanafi ones, was the pursuit of propriatary principals about upholding consistency elsewhere? maliki&rsquo;s are also women friendly in divorce maliki&rsquo;s are where modern legistators took their divorce rulings maliki&rsquo;s tend to care much more about the women hanafi school is the playing out of Kufan traditions against women &ldquo;step inside the discourses and try to view them from within&rdquo; `}),e.add({id:809,href:"/posts/islamic_jurisprudence_lecture_12/",title:"islamic jurisprudence lecture 12",content:`Tags: islamic jurisprudence

Question: &ldquo;Why are you in Iraq?&rdquo;
Brain: because I have some undiagnosed form of self-loathing and decided that this country was going to be my therapist. I wish I had some nice orientialist fantasies, at least those guys had a reason for being out here.
Me: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a researcher doing fieldwork out here.&rdquo;
Question: &ldquo;How long have you been in Iraq?&rdquo;
Brain: how can anyone tell time in this country when everything is &ldquo;tomorrow inshallah&rdquo; and there&rsquo;s an absolute disregard, maybe even contempt of the concept of time out here
Me: &ldquo;Oh I&rsquo;m in and out every few months, but I live in Kurdistan usually.&rdquo;
Question: &ldquo;Do you like the food here?&rdquo;
Brain: No but you obviously can&rsquo;t say that so shut your trap and say something nice.
Me: &ldquo;Yeah qoozi is delicious.&rdquo;
Question: &ldquo;Your Arabic is good!&rdquo;
Brain: No my Arabic is dogshit and every day I feel like a child having to ask people to repeat themselves or explain words I don&rsquo;t understand, please please do not tell me that it is good
Me: &ldquo;Haha thanks! I hope to practice it more&rdquo;
Question: &ldquo;Which country are you from?&rdquo;
Me: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m from China&rdquo;
Them: &ldquo;Oh Jackie Chan!&rdquo;
Question: &ldquo;Do you like Iraq?/Is Iraq beautiful?&rdquo;
Brain: Iraq is great except when I have to consider the ethics of being out here. You know how in the Middle Ages, those crazy beaked doctors would cut you open, poked around randomly, and you either died or lived? It&rsquo;s like that. We foriegners bombed this country open, and now all the foreigners including me run around poking at different bits of the body with zero coordination as the patient is dying on the table? Yeah it&rsquo;s like that
Me: &ldquo;Iraq is beautiful and the people are friendly!&rdquo;

Karim and Beardsley, “Explaining Sexual Exploitation and Abuse in Peacekeeping Missions.”
Uses the composition of peacekeeping troops along two dimensions - proportions of women and the records of gender (inequality) in the contributing countries to track for sexual exploitation and abuse (SEA)
mission level information from 2009 to 2013 indicates that higher levels of female peacekeepers and personnel from countries with better records of gender equality is associated with lower levels of SEA allegations
2015 office of internal oversight services released a report that made headlines
SEA hinders UNSCR 1325 proclaims to study this &ldquo;in depth&rdquo;
Nordas and Rustad find that SEA is more frequently reported in situations with lower levels of battle-related deaths, larger loperations, and more recent operations, in ops where the conflict involved high levels of sexual violence
they find that gender norms on the representation of women within the coutnry is inversely correlated with SEA allegations
some evidence that the representation of women in peacekeeping missions helps shapes the SEA allegation counts

working title: ooda&rsquo;s in Kubernetes
Kubernetes control plane is like the ooda (observe orient decide act), combines two main factors:
how kubernetes controllers respond to external stimuli duration/frequency of external stimuli? intensity aka amplitude of external stimuli? when this stimuli comes in, how do we reconcile this with what we want? statelessness sources:
https://commoncog.com/blog/much-ado-about-the-ooda-loop/ gasch: events, the dna of kubernetes bowes: level triggering and reconciliation Draft: The fundalmental building block in the Kubernetes (k8s) lego box is the concept of a k8s controller, a program that implements a control loop that is responsible for moving k8s towards the desired state.
I thought it was interesting how similar this was to the OODA loop1, which is a decision making process that breaks down into 4 stages:
Observe Orient Decide Act Now this is relatively banal, most people already take this sort of decision making process into their daily lives. However, what I want to drill down into is how this process is stateless, that is, you don&rsquo;t actually need to persist any information between one iteration loop and into the next.
An example: pretend you are setting up a k8s ReplicaSet. This ReplicaSet is responsible for spinning up a certain number of Docker containers, organized into k8s pods, say 3 pods2. Now k8s handles this behavior like so on the first iteration:
observe the number of pods already running for this replicaset (at iteration 0, this is 0 pods) compute the difference between the desired amount and current amount (at iteration 0, this is desired-current = 3-0 = 3 pods): https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/pkg/controller/replicaset/replica_set.go#L542 decide whether pods need to be spun up or down: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/pkg/controller/replicaset/replica_set.go#L548 spin up pods or spin down pods accordingly This is exactly an OODA loop3! Kubernetes observes the current state, orients itself, and then decides to act upon the given information. Now, if you pretend one of the 3 pods has failed to spin up. Iteration 1 would look like:
observe the number of pods already running (iteration 1, this is 2 pods) compute the difference between the desired and current (iteration 1, this is 3-2=1 pod) decide/act on the information What&rsquo;s interesting here is that no state was stored between iteration 0 and iteration 1. Iteration 1 did not need any information from iteration 0 to perform its actions, rather, iteration 1 oriented itself based on the current state of the world (that two pods already existed).
Now, you might say that this system is not actually stateless, since there was state encapsulated within the number of pods already running. While this is true, it&rsquo;s important to note that we never explicitly managed the state, that is, we never allocated any variables to track any information generated within the loop. Using this OODA loop, Kubernetes has managed to perform stateful actions while keeping the implementation stateless.
In fact, Michael Gasch&rsquo;s great article on Kubernetes events points this out as well.&#160;&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;
For simplicity we&rsquo;ll pretend each docker container maps to one pod, although this isn&rsquo;t really necessary information.&#160;&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;
This example is a little contrived since steps 3 and 4 are merged.&#160;&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;

Class 1 What do linguists do? Linguists as part of cognitive science What is the consquences of this view? Chomsky - Syntatic Structures as the dawn of generative grammar There exists some sentences of setnences such that it allows for recursive composition So once we setup the idea that English cannot be a FSM, what is the data? Langauges that use case markings case markings allow it to mtaintain a more consistent structure modulo case marking chomsky is unconcerned with the statistical metadata that arises from a corpus &ldquo;internalist&rdquo; - grammars and structures within a single sentence &ldquo;externalist&rdquo; - set of sentences within a corpus for sentences to make sense, we assign a phoronlogical structure to pronounce sentences which then means a sentence makes sense iff: syntax (chomsky is here) is correct phoronological sufficent (this can be derived from statistics) &ldquo;there exists a faculty of language&rdquo; - but is there a single faculty of langauge Class 2 - 9/13 what is the neo-durkheimian relationship between langauge and thought? is language just a set of sentences? in the 70&rsquo;s, they thought that sentences are a sequence of words or sounds what does this leave out? -&gt; hidden syntax and semantics syntax cannot directly be seen semantics sometimes contain a truth value oftentimes this forms the \\(\\{form/sound, meaning\\}\\) chomsky identified this as a triplet of \\(\\{form, syntax, meaning\\}\\) sentences in english are infinite due to recursion (aka not finite structured)_ chomsky also distinguished between &ldquo;lists&rdquo; and &ldquo;conjunctions&rdquo; lists as \\(\\mathbb{N}\\) however, langauge (or at least english) is &ldquo;uninterestingly&rdquo; infinite as you push further out and generate more sentences, the sentences themselves become regularized for chomsky, grammar is the compression of language, and if you memorize words you can generate an infinite set of sentences also must make a distinction between &ldquo;actual&rdquo; and &ldquo;potential&rdquo; &ldquo;actual&rdquo; sentences are bound by the maximum speaker time or computation time &ldquo;potential&rdquo; sentences are the infinite set of all sentences generatable what are the grammatical rules for telling us if a word is an actual word? &ldquo;moak&rdquo; -&gt; is this a word? we have grammars to say this is a potential word, but to reject a word, we actually do a semi-exhaustive search through our internal dictionaries to find out some words enter the vernacular after it is used &ldquo;jabberwocky&rdquo;, for example how do we distinguish words that are archaeic/low frequency from words that are incorrect? side note finite state languages can delinate infinite sets this is known as the &ldquo;strong and weak generative capacity&rdquo; what was the theory of cognitive science before the 60&rsquo;s? behavioralism learning is the intentional modification of the environment in order to produce different future behaviors what is actually being &ldquo;learned&rdquo; when you acquire a langauge? a child does not do a blind word/object association (i.e. this is a ball) the faculty of langauge extends beyond this into &ldquo;teaching&rdquo; or &ldquo;learning&rdquo; a grammar and a generative capacity grammars have variance built in this is why we speak differently language accomodation in arabic Class 3 - 9/15 Mendel&rsquo;s laws - laws of inheritances that require abstract concepts like genes organized in such a way that gives rise to laws linguistic laws grimm&rsquo;s law - stated in terms of independent sounds - phonemes werner&rsquo;s law before these system laws, the idea that sound changes happened consistently/completely across langauges when chomsky says linguistics as a cognitive science this is not to reject the generalization finding tools dan everett - linguist in piraha no recursion in this language he proposes it comes from culture many things are understood about linguistics via numbers and color systems how to understand rules? through the enforcement of cultural roles how are the roles communicated and enforced? what happens if you violate it? shades of similarity to hart&rsquo;s theory of law studies about generalizablity of specific groups have never been totally innocent - largely driven by social policy does grimm&rsquo;s law focus on the right things? are phonemes the correct unit of generalization? the persuasion of a generalization lies in the correlation of its properties future is tied up with the concept of &ldquo;irrealis&rdquo; modals, conditions future counterfactuals future tense does not seem to be a a fundalmental building blocks of language present tense is a mess because stateive and others grimm&rsquo;s laws are simple, but the explanation could be complicated &ldquo;laws&rdquo; of languages often end up generalizing idiosyncratic effects to that languge anthropoligists suggest that systematic study of langauge by pieces that exhibit discontinuities reflect culture is culture downstream of langauge? compositionality meaning is composition labels can be generated from the hash of meaning label is the form/shape/demarker of the word? Class 5 - 9/22 Is phornology finite state? is it less powerful than finite state? why do we care where in the brain something happens it matters how the brain recongizes faces, but to do so, we must first learn where jakobson invariance /t/ - phoneme, slashes denote an obstruct t /t/ - goes into \\([t^h]\\) (as in &ldquo;top&rdquo;) and \\([t]\\) (as in &ldquo;stop&rdquo;, this doesn&rsquo;t actually exist in mandarin) the other inviariance is when you have two different phonemmes, but how do we know what the nominative case is? Jakobson says it is meaning the features are semantic ones therefore, it was incorrect to think of this as the level of the phoneme, but rather we should look at it from the meaning internal/eternal prinicple of contrast example: &ldquo;top&rdquo; vs &ldquo;(t^)hop&rdquo; - your pronouncation of &ldquo;t&rdquo; does not change the menaining, therefore the asperation is not used to define meaning feature grounding - in terms of articulation, Jakobson thought we should use acoustics (wrong) paper fights with sausser meaning is distinct because it arises from the rest of the words cat vs dog, elephant, etc sausser says language is ungrounded and that it arises from scarcity it is because meaning can be generated through differences, like a hash function what about religion? what does the invariance come from? jakobson is still a version of structuralism are word embeddings structuralist? quine - early sentence embeddings -&gt; the context is what matters, the company it keeps possiblies of derivational frequencies derevational family entropy says there is neural reponse why do generalizations happen in suffixes in english? Class 6 - 9/27 Standard linguistics metholdogy is the method of contrast principles contrast structures that are parallels examples: Toler- Teach- Clash tolerant (adj) teach (/) Clash (noun) tolerance (noun) teach Clash (verb) tolerate (verb) tolerable (adj) the (/) suffix is somethimes null, which contrasts with the existence sometimes sometimes the metholodgy tells you the suffix is null when you read toler[ate|ance|able] your brain generates the frequency distribution we have entropy/uncertainty over the continuities, called derivational family entropy derivational family entropy on mandarin? example: unflush(/) - no unflushable - yes why does (un) require a suffix? what does linguistics look like with implementation within the brain? context free - a sentence consists of a noun phrase and a verb phrase case markings - NP-&gt; NPACC/v- when a noun phrase is accusative when its next to a verb, which are context sensitive A context free grammar cannot be duplicated. Lanugages like Yoruba which exhibits duplication, &ldquo;buildhouse-buildhouse&rdquo; -&gt; builder Swiss german is the only clear examples of midly context-sensitive Context-free is recursive (no memory) for some languages, context sensitivy is used only for certain features, like reduplication in Yoruba why is this a problem? this points to an issue where human langauges have certain mathematical properties that map to the brain langauges are not evenly distributed between context free &amp; context sensitive distribution maybe we can&rsquo;t process certain context sensitivity finite -&gt; computablably enumerable are rough categories pholonogy is theorized to be subregular morpohology and syntax are much more complicated Class 7 - 9/29 repetition implies context sensitivty does english have similar properties? np by np construction &ldquo;dog after dog&rdquo; is different than &ldquo;little by little&rdquo; little by little is not a noun phrase noun phrases are potentially infinite heinz and isardi claim that phronology is sub-regular constraints on grammar generally deal with locality grammar trees can show you how things block locality regular, natural, and CFG&rsquo;s circle layering stabler for each grammar of a specific type (MC) there eixists an efficient parser stabler - subregularity of syntax gives you constraints on languages some sentences cannot be extracted from subject and adjunct called CED by J Huang for langauges can do subextraction from subject example: &ldquo;what did pictures of fall on Fred&rdquo; -&gt; &ldquo;what&rdquo; must be extracted from subject merge ops even if you limit ones to subregular, the merge operations does whatever you want noun-phrase is equivilant to a noun-prep phrase, since a noun-phrase is a merge of noun-prep let us assume subregular grammar math is the math used for human language -&gt; formal universal langauges have nouns and verbs as invariants -&gt; Jakobson Stabler sees that we parse strings of words: word by word do you generate sentences on your own until you find a match? inefficient and non-deterministic since we do not wait until the end of a sentence before parsing it, model a sentence interpretation as a probability distribution that&rsquo;s incremental lineraly porportional to the number of words using the finite set of words and finite set of rules: the cross product of both gives you the search space `}),e.add({id:917,href:"/posts/languages_lingustics/",title:"languages/linguistics",content:`Tags: root

Language learning, in my opinion, is actually an extremely boring ask, filled with mostly just one thing: reptition. Hours put into the language is directly correlated with how much of the language you know, and while there&rsquo;s some slight tricks you can apply, in the end it&rsquo;s just hours of classes and Anki.

Summary Deep learning uses multiple layers to learn representations of data with multiple levels of abstraction
Supervised Learning most common
show inputs and annotations
create an objective function that measures errors
most people use stochastic gradient descent
known since 1960 that linear classifers only carve their input space into very simple regions (half spaces separated by a hyperplane)
multiple non-linear layers from 5-20, system can implement extremely intricate functions
Backprops for multilayer the derivative of the objective with respect to the input of a module can be computed by working backwards from the gardient wrt to the output of that module ReLu maps fixed-size input to fixed-size output late 1990&rsquo;s commonly thought that simple gradient descent would get caught in local minima rarely a problem for gradient descent in practice CNN&rsquo;s covolutional neural networks RNN&rsquo;s recurrent neural networks (rnn) `}),e.add({id:931,href:"/posts/legal_basis_of_the_hashd/",title:"legal basis of the hashd",content:`Tags: Knight et al - Honored, Not Contained, hashd al-shaabi (PMF)

https://lwn.net/Articles/276782/ Intro What does a linker do? Converts object files into executables and shared libraries C/C++/Fortran (java uses a loader) What&rsquo;s a linker: Dynamic linking, linker data types, linker operation Shared libs shared libs were invented as an op for virtual memory systems running many processes simultaneously virtual memory system would map the same routine for each process first implementation in SVR3, based on COFF assigned each shared library a fixed portion of virtual address space SunOS4 introduced a more fleixbile version programs would link shared librarys during runtime (dynamic linker) program linker are the linkers during compilation Basic Linker Data Types Linkers use symbols, relocations, and contents Symbols Name and a value usually represent static objects in the original source code For C, a single symbol for each function and each global and static variable used to indicate a reference to a name defined in another file Relocation Computation to perform on the contents Usually refers to a symbol and a offset Also provides an additional operand called addend Simple relocation is &ldquo;set this location in the contents to the value of this symbol + addend&rdquo; Contents What memory should look like during the execution of the program Have a size, array of bytes, and a type Contain machine code generated by the compiler and assembler (text) Also contain values of initialized variables (data) Also contain static unnamed data like string constants or switch varialbes (rdata) Empty uninitalized variables as well Basic Linker Operation Linkers:
Read input object files, determine the length and types of contents, reads the symbols. Build a symbol table containing all the symbols, linking undefined symbols to their definitions. Decide where the contents should go in the output executable file, which means deciding where they should go in memory when the program runs Reads the contents data and the relocations, apply the relocations to the contents, write the result to the output file Optionally write out the complete symbol table with the final value of the symbols `}),e.add({id:944,href:"/posts/linkers/",title:"linkers",content:`Tags: compilers

Middle east studies has had many people contend over it Beginnings rooted in the study in &ldquo;Ancient Greece&rdquo; Linking between Athens and US/Britian is to distort history by projecting our own conceptions onto the past The idea that &ldquo;Asian&rdquo; countries were ruled by tyrants and people were servile is very old, barbarians at the gate Roman legacies were pronouced, especially as the empire split Word of god often used to justify the large-scale enslavement and European conquest European writers tended to see muslims in ethnic rather than religious views Crusades were largely bludgeoning as well &ldquo;Knowing the enemy&rdquo; became big in the middle ages, for revival purposes Ibn Sina, Ibn Rushd, Maimonides all read arabic Perceptions of the Ottomans as in perpetual decline Ottoman law, society, and statecraft were seen as despotic The west saw the east as a place to define what the west was Spread of empire brought about cultural orietnialism, such as eroticized and titillating drawings of Muslims Akin to modern fetishism of Muslim women/KRG women Marx bought into this as well, the economic basis for despotism was characteristic of Asian societies &ldquo;Indian society has no history at all&rdquo; Also saw colonialism as a necessary and progressive factor in human history American large influences on middle east studies via foundations following WWII, in light of the cold war First strains were largely orientalist, it took islam as a coherent civilization that was static and unchanging Concepts of an &ldquo;Arab mind&rdquo; or &ldquo;Muslim mind&rdquo; Followed by strong strains of modernization theory (1950&rsquo;s 1970&rsquo;s) Failure of modernization theory with lebanese civil war Disillusionment with government work Shortage of people with language skills in government Modernization theory saw local elites playing a crucial role in introducing change into societies (like the Shah) Orientialism drew a sharp line between Islam and the West, modernization theory drew sharp divide between tradition and modernity, two different stages in one human evolution Turmoil started w/ Abdel-Malek&rsquo;s Egypt: Military Society Modernization theory&rsquo;s failures in Latin America made it suspect Seminal article &ldquo;Sociology of Development and Underdevelopment of Society&rdquo; Showed that there were greater benefits to breaking out of capitalist investment system Vietnam War&rsquo;s breakdown of US consensus Rereadings of history followed Islamism&rsquo;s rise posed a problem for modernization theory Orientialism Argued with a focult conception what we take to be truth is in fact always really the product of a certain way of depicting or representing reality, of a certain “discourse” – a structured system of meaning which shapes what we perceive, think and do. Rather, he saw power as an inherent feature of all human social relations, and moreover as productive: it was in the matrices of the power relations that permeated social relations that discourses, practices and institutions were generated, including even our own subjective sense of ourselves, rooted in the modern notion that we are largely autonomous, self-governing, rational individuals. For Said, orientalism was a discourse in that it was a language used to describe and build the concept of the west This Western representation of the Orient was predicated on the assumption that “East” and “West” were radically and irreducibly different, and (using primarily philological methods) drew on presumably authoritative texts to produce and sustain certain ideas about the Orient, among them Oriental despotism and Oriental sensuality. Asked us how we represent other cultures, what are the forms of knowledge production? Does not actually lambast the field, but asks us to look at the recieved wisdom &ldquo;In part, Clifford argued, the problem lay in Said’s effort to derive Orientalism as a discourse, in Foucault’s sense, from his inventory of Orientalism as a tradition, relying heavily on a survey of literary and scholarly texts.&rdquo; Poststructuralism and &ldquo;linguistic turn&rdquo; Said brought Foucault&rsquo;s approach to new intellectual terrain &ldquo;Nonetheless, the “invasion” of French theory in various forms in the 1970s and 1980s certainly stimulated vigorous intellectual debates and important developments in many ﬁelds.&rdquo; The linguistic turn refers to not specific languages, but that langauge (any coherent and structured meaning-bearing system, from actual human langauges to social customs and etc, provided the best metaphor for social relations). as a self-contained system of “signs” whose meanings are determined by their relations to each other, rather than by their relation to some “transcendental” or extralinguistic object or subject . . . Such a commitment would seem to imply that language not only shapes experienced reality but constitutes it, that different languages create different, discontinuous, and incommensurable worlds, that the creation of meaning is impersonal, operating “behind the backs” of language users whose linguistic actions can merely exemplify the rules and procedures of languages they inhabit but do not control, that all specialized language usages in a culture (scientiﬁc, poetic, philosophical, historical) are similarly determined by and constitutive of their putative objects.
The understanding of the lingustic turn meant that scholarship had to determine how these systems of meaning governed people
Also implied there was no access to a fixed reality, that scholars should study how the nexus of knowledge are formed
This meant, among other things, abandoning the idea of “experience” as denoting what human beings purportedly learn from their encounters with the real world, since there were no such encounters that were not already and always mediated, structured, ﬁltered by some discourse. What an individual or group “learned” from some “experience” – for example, of exploitation or oppression – depended crucially on the discourse which structured how that experience was made sense of.

Summary Talks about how people are influenced on their views of intelligent systems based on their first impressions and their familiartiy with the topic.
Notably, domain experts fail to regain trust in the system, even if the system gets better over time. Consistently achieve automation bias and believe in the system, even if it is wrong.
Domain expertise plays an important role.
Implications &ldquo;Rather than allowing users to use a system with zero understanding or a poor mental model of how the system works, designers can incorporate introductory sessions to alert users about system strengths and shortcomings so that users can decide whether and when they should trust the system&rsquo;s outputs. Alternatively, designers can provide a high-level overview of the model with key information (e.g., system accuracy and known weaknesses) that can influence impression formation.&rdquo; (Nourani et al 2020:8)
What does this mean for your product? You can&rsquo;t explain away bad results to domain experts, they consistently rate it below even if the explainability is high
this implies that the models need to be very correct on the first pass
for post-conflict statebuilding organization, does this mean that people who experience bueauracries less if the intial assessment is bad? Does this relate to unbanked people?

Syntax is at the core of generative grammar sentences of a language as a sequence of units that re-occur can be sounds, roughly represented by words (letters as a semiotic of sounds) what separates a word salad (sentence with no meaning) and a sentence with meaning? are human languages finite state languages, aka those generated from finite state grammars? - chomsky separators of phrases (commas and words) cannot be replaced without losing meaning, but we can insert additional phrases in between without losing original meaning however, does chomsky operate on only made up sentences? We can infinitely nest variables and sentences, but does this map nicely back to human language? which lends to a rules based analysis, but we can move beyond the rules based analysis and speakers can produce and understand sentences they haven&rsquo;t heard before every finite corpus of setnences represents an accidental sampling of utterances which means the rules can be used to project future sentences do linguists largely predict data they don&rsquo;t have, based on rules they can&rsquo;t verify? computational people vs linguists &ldquo;linguistic enterprise is about the knowledge of language that underlies everything that a speaker does with their language&rdquo; computational people typically have a very specific use case of language (e.g. parsing a web query) anthropology vs linguistics what is the relationship between culture and language? marantz argues that the language itself is a bad lens to analyze culture for Piraha by Everett, Marantz thinks that culutral constraints cannot explain behavior that strictly adheres to the constraints, a study of cultural constraints requires you to think on the boundaries and what transgresses the constraints argues that lingusits are cognitive neuroscientists, who operate at many levels of abstractions `}),e.add({id:993,href:"/posts/marjah/",title:"marjah",content:`Tags: helmand

New Outline (September 10, 2022) Similar to old one, but focused on the concept of change start with institutions representing the past, and shaabi representing the future Introduction What is a ritual? Literature review on the main ideas I depart from these because permanent/recurring pilgrimage (Shikoku pilgrims) looking at people who service pilgrims, and how they see it as a permanent pilgrimage ritualistic voyeurism the confrontation of moral life and actual life create the space and confirm and create the power of religious symbols symbols are imposed yet not seen to be created In addition, this work serves as a brief overview of a history of Karbala, and it&rsquo;s grapple with politics, militias, religious authority, and pilgrims, as well as an ethnographic account of ritual shaabi Chapter 1 - The (near but distant) Past - Infrastructures Institutions of mokwebs, radoods, and their history Main character Ali Qazwini Ali the radood school teacher Authority is mixed here, use this chapter to explain how political (hashd, religious authority, history) The physical space of the shrines, where rituals perform next to each other, where funerals are next to other rituals, children running around as others bury the body graduation ceremonies as well Radood, poet, mowkeb, radat radoods work with certain poets each pmowkeb has a few poets that stay with them and write anywhere there is a shrine there is a radat, in kathimiya, in najaf taraf abassiyya is famous for having political mowkebs, even though everyone says they&rsquo;re political hasan kathim interview here actual ritual performance in bayn haramiin, with signs, then howdij, then radat, and then ends with a latm tatbir and it&rsquo;s nature how does the hashd and military feed into this? performance of &ldquo;security&rdquo; carried out lala can and her book? mowkeb facts 3000 service mowkebs in Karbs 75 from karbala itself 115 majalis al-aza people visit the administration for all sorts of reasons each mowkeb is from a historical place, sometimes there is an expansion from the baladiyya permissions needed: interior ministry within the city baladia local permission polics each mokweb collects money from people donations start the day after arabeen for the next year&rsquo;s mowkeb 90% (sus number) are wrong new ones learn from the old ones 200 make majlis 3000 for services radood school experience Chapter 2 - The Present - Participation Main character: Muntazir the radood What does participating in a ritual look like? Participating in ego boundary reduction Karbalaei natives as a different type of prilgrim Majlis experience, radoods Zaman Hawnawi, again threats of being wal&rsquo;ai register of vernacular majlis husseni and majlis aza Latm and Radat draw in participants talk about the differences between ritual shaabi and ritual 3di hajj sayyid interview here Chapter 3 - The Future as an Alternative Present - Repetition main character, taraf abassiyya list out the main old mowkebs here The repetition and performance allows for a particular voyeuristic view How is it voyeuristic? How does this create a different future? self flattering notions, such as the guy faked who sings about putting dirt in their eyes Notions of competition, and status making Because it is so public, it serves as a platform for statements of piety or politics Because it is an oral tradition, it must be constantly reproduced Under saddam years, it&rsquo;s noted that these rituals survived through houses Because one has to be recognized as a pilgrim and a servant through this public nature through this mutual recognition, we can see&hellip;something they access a particular time through this harmonization it&rsquo;s not just about being a good pilgrim, but about being seen as a good pilgrim finding husbands for women and showing off for men Karbala offers a platform for the surival of rituals, people can envision a variety of futures (watan, hosa, religion, etc) Azerbaijani flag, Iraqi flags is this repetition to be in the presence of something, like the salafists Conclusion Audience view themselves as part of a shared understanding future studies Register of tradgey is particularly susceptible to notions of the future? al-shur, ulema, criticisms of how people believe what the radood instead of what the shiekh says, contention of authority tatbir and it&rsquo;s fitna zangeel discrimination of karbala and baghdad Outline - Forming the Present Through Husseiniyya Rituals Each center chapter follows a single character and tries to focus the lens around them, zooming out to describe the concept Goal is to move towards a theory of a constructed present Starts with the center of the ritual (radood and audience), goes to describing the institutions, then goes to describe how a &ldquo;normal&rdquo; person participates Introduction Thesis: rituals as a sight of constructing the present Lead in: evoking the Imam as a nearhuman construction (Johnson - Automatic Religion) Various rituals of approaching the shrine One understudied area is the role of the radood Main key is that the majlis with radood is a specific form ritual that binds individual and society, future and past Main questions to answer: How do ritual participants view themselves? Do they see rituals as subsuming the self? What about the &ldquo;violent&rdquo; nature of specific rituals? How are these rituals sustained? Look to al-Wardi lamahat vol 2 Chapter 1 - Majilis Husseini/al-3aza Experience Mainly enthographic chapter Main character might be Mutathir the radood Main questions to answer: What is it like to be in a ritual? Radood audience interaction to draw in the audience Where do the rituals happen? What contexts are they performed in? What are the casual forms of difference (between Pakistani, Iraqi, Indian, etc) What is invoked and evoked with the ritual? Is it saddness for Hussein (as some ritual participants have said), or is it something more? Banal nature of the rituals, and how it is not necessarily different than music festivals The banality of these rituals actually make it much more interesting, because it reveals how easily new views of the world are fashioned even without a clear sacred/profane distinction Look to Geertz here, what symbols are floating around? For Sahlins, what kind of kinship is being produced in this moment? How are the symbols alive here (al-Shur?) Also potentially useful to look at Tanya Luhrmann&rsquo;s work on Evanglicial Christian prayers and esoteric mental states of trance Chapter 2 - Institutions of the Radoods and Mowkebs Investigative chapter around what religious institutions sustain the radoods Main character: Ali the radood school teacher How does Ali engage by creating the institution of radoods Who comes to school? What are their backgrounds? Questions to answer What seemingly non-religious work needs to be done to sustain this structure? How is authority created? Who creates these authorities, and are they done by the &ldquo;religious&rdquo; or &ldquo;secular&rdquo;? Is that even an useful distinction to draw here? Chapter 3 - Majilis as a pilgrimage Main character: Fathal the security guard Karbalaei native, but not particularly religious Goal is to show how &ldquo;regular&rdquo; people engage with religion Look to Asad here, what types of self is attempting to be molded by going to this pilgrimage? How do pilgrims signal to each other about the status of their pilgrimage? How does the shrine institutions support this? This chapter might be cut or revised, it&rsquo;s a little vague right now Conclusion Husseiniyya rituals draw in the audience and participants through N ways This allows the audience to view themselves in a different way, constructing a different present One underaddressed aspect within this study is the register of tragedy, which is potential for future work Old Peacebuilding Reintegration of Iraqi Militias PMF Command Structures PMF command structures are vastly different, from KH&rsquo;s Hezbollah-like situation to brigade 30 Money laundering and ghost soldiers Who is lining their pockets and benefiting from different command structures? Sectarian conflicts PMF cross cuts class, race, and religion Shia Turkmen, Christians, pro-sistani vs pro-iran What kind of nationalism is being created? Alternatively, what kinds of sub-state nationalism (borrowing Toby Dodge) is being created? Similar reintegration histories? Peacebuilding in Balkans Reintegration of Bosnia mujahadeen? &ldquo;Recyled&rdquo; militia in Serbia armed groups? Lebanon Hezbollah and similarities there? Nepal Ideaologically driven - were maoist. Does this hold similarities? Afghanistan Taliban Namibia Colombia Paramilitary demobilization, and it&rsquo;s failures Chechnya Militias as spoilers of the Chechen state, does this occur in Iraq? Ivory Coast &ldquo;Warrior generation&rdquo;, political violence similar levels, are there models to be drawn here? Post-conflict peacebuilding within formal state structures The Iraqi state did not totally collapse and fought off an insurgency, is this different than integrating militias in newly formed states? External actors UNAMI US Iran etc Mechanics of peacebuilding Combants to civilains -&gt; Has this happened? Post-conflict state -&gt; Has Iraqi society reached &ldquo;post-conflict&rdquo;? What determines post-conflict? &ldquo;Big&rdquo; questions Current government framing of Iraq Lack of legitmacy on several key institutions &ldquo;Supreme&rdquo; court has no constitutional legitmacy KRG Resolved issues of KRG disputes, how do the peshmerga fit into this equation? What constitutes as &ldquo;rehabilitation&rdquo; and &ldquo;reintegration&rdquo;? UN has often sought &ldquo;reintegration&rdquo; by waiting it out, which has rarely worked. Succesful examples are Nepal and Namibia, which sought greater reintegration via massive state-sponsered jobs programs How does this change in a world of low interest rates? Namibia and Nepal had difficulties borrowing money, does the shift in the global markets affect this? &ldquo;Big&rdquo; reintegration - who are the funders of reintegration for previous states? Who funds reintegration for the Iraqi state? Who directs reintegration? Often times funded and directed in DC, but acted upon in other states What do we reintegrate back into? Reintegration implies return to prewar &ldquo;normalcy&rdquo; &ndash; the same conditions that gestated the conflict. Sierra Leone of 2005 looks like the Sierra Leone of 1991 What structural changes are available? What does this look like in the backdrop of Arab Spring? Of the 2019/2020 protests? Unknown quesitons War veterans in post-war situations Refusal to reintegrate? Similarities to societal groups like Turkey&rsquo;s war vets? External communities How do the communities reintegrating the militia members feel? What about disapora? Generational questions &ldquo;Reintegration&rdquo; implies that there is a life to go back to. Are militia members who spent their lives in conflict have this open as an opportunity?

Scaling laws are one big unsolved problem in machine learning, and especially NLP. NLP hits the sweet spot where the problems are hard enough to still require ongoing research, but problems are also easy enough to have real practical applications, so the field continues to get funded. One problem some people have raised is the idea of a &ldquo;mesa optimizer&rdquo;, or a model that has learned a generic way of solving a task that may not be directly what you expect. For example, a computer that plays Chess may eventually figure out how to do heuristic tree-pruning. Originally I was pretty against this idea, it seems somewhat silly, there&rsquo;s no real proof that we&rsquo;ll ever develop anything that produces a mesa optimizer. However, I&rsquo;ve become more of a mesa optimizer truther with time, the more I read about linguistics, the more likely I think mesa optimizers are going to end up.
I was reading a paper by Hauser, Chomsky, and Finch on how to approach the study of linguistics, and they distinguish between what they call an FLN and a FLB, or a faculty of language narrow, and a facaulty of language broad. In short, they define FLN to be centered around the idea of recursion, that the discovery of recursion is the key distinguishing feature for human languages vs animal languages. They provide the example that human babies can infer the existence of &ldquo;4&rdquo; after learning 1, 2, and 3, but primates require learning each one individually.
This is all fine, we can easily construct sentences that require recursion (the sentence &ldquo;Mary said that Jane said that Tom said…&rdquo;). Zaccarella and Friederici talk about how they’ve identified a single area of the brain that performs the &ldquo;merge operation&rdquo;, where you can convert “the&quot; and “fish&quot; into a single linguistic unit if &ldquo;the fish&rdquo; but not “fish” and “the”. [BRAIN MERGE PAPER] identifies that Broca’s Area 44, near the center of your brain, lights up when it needs to perform this operation. If we accept that merge operations are necessary for recursion, since you need to be able to merge parts after finishing recursion, we can then believe that recursion has some biological basis.
But what does recursion allow us to get away with? If we can infer the existence of 4 from knowing 1, 2, and 3, and we can also infer the existence of 5 from knowing 1-4, and so on, what does this actually get us? Here, recursion offers a compression, rather than learning every single number individually, recursion lets us compress numbers down to the n+1 rule. If we know that every number bigger than n can eventually be derived from performing n+1 some artibrary amount of times, there’s no need to memorize every larger number. Similarly, with some basic units (verbs, adjectives, nouns, etc) and a simple set of rules (subject comes before verb, object comes after verb, etc) we can construct English sentences. There’s no need to memorize all (or even most) of the English sentences in existence, you can simply rederive them with a set of rules.
To use an analogy, this would be similar to printing every possible path from your home to work, versus learning how to read a compass and learning which directions the roads go. You could certainly list every single combination of roads that take you to work (I can start on A road and then go to B, or I can start on C road and go to B to connect with D…), or you could simply learn that your work is southeast of your home, and that roads generally go north/south between the two places.
Hubinger et al wrote about the theoretical concept of a &ldquo;mesa optimizer&rdquo;. This is the concept that if you teach a model to do something, and subject it to intense evolutionary pressure, you can end up with what’s know as a &ldquo;mesa optimizer&rdquo;. One example given in the paper is teaching models to play Chess/Shogi/Go, where after enough iterations, the model may simply develop a heuristic tree pruning algorithm. In another example, we could think about solving a maze: you start off with the model learning to explore every possible maze path, but eventually it could develop a generic path-finding algorithm like A*. In these two cases, the heuristic tree-pruning algorithm and A* are both &ldquo;mesa optimizers&rdquo;.
Once thing that Hubinger et al identify is that &ldquo;mesa optimizers&rdquo; are &ldquo;compressible&rdquo;, or that they take up less memory space (described as bits) and less computation than other options. For example, in Chess, it would take a lot of memory space and computational time to list out every single possible game state. It would be much more efficient space-wise to develop a generic algorithm, such as heuristic tree-pruning, rather than figure out every single situation.
This is the connection between mesa optimizers and linguistic recursion: both are compressed forms of the greater problem. Mesa optimizers are context dependent, rather than figuring out every possible situation beforehand, mesa optimizers use the current information around the game state to figure out the next move. For language, Chomsky developed the idea of context-free and context-sensitive grammars, English words change meaning and form based on the words around it. Yet we’re able to understand the potentially infinite set of English sentences despite only learning a very small percentage, simply because we’ve learned the rules. The recursive nature of English allows us to learn some basic rules and generate and understand far more than what we’ve experienced.
So if it follows that mesa optimizers and languages are similar in that they both capture more efficient forms of a problem, what does this idea do for us? For one, mesa optimizers are purely theoretical (although Deepmind has claimed they developed a proto-one), but language recursion is not. Language recursion via the merge operation has taken a particular role within a small part of our brain, which presents another quandry: if language recursion via the merge operation is such a key component, why would it, evolutionarily speaking, be bottlenecked to a single portion of the brain? To me, I see this as we’re in the early stages of evolution building specific components for recursion: our brains have not fulled evolved to the point where multiple parts can perform the merge operation. But despite that, we’ve been able to do a lot with only a single portion! For Chomsky, this is a major evolutionary leap, not an iterative one. We did not slowly get to recursion, but rather we managed to develop it, and suddenly the modes of communication dramatically multiplied. Speculatively speaking, this means that, if mesa optimizers were to develop, their evolution would not be iterative, I would expect a mesa optimizer to emerge out of the blue at some point, once we’ve reached neural networks with sufficient dataset size, or computational capability, just as GPT-3 does not demonstrate the ability to do single digit arithmatic until 1B parameters, but the jump is quite dramatic:
I’m not sure where this leaves my thinking on this, I started out totally rejecting the idea of mesa optimizers, but as I read more about linguisitics and the conumdrum that linguists have in trying to figure out how language emerged, I’m beginning to be more open to the idea that mesa optimizers could also emerge out of the blue.

Engineers after 1951 moved the groundwater wells out of the city center and towards urban periphery + deep drainage tunnels called Deep Drainage System (Sistema del Drenaje Profundo)
finished in 1975 four olympic size swimming pools of water are expelled per minute from the tunnels wastewater that couldn&rsquo;ve been treated is wasted causing the water table to fall transformed water problems from a catastropic problems to creeping one present day no longer sufficient during rainy season South and Eastern Mexico City&rsquo;s wells are gone and poor residents lack adequate water service

Talks about how initially, economics was focused on tangible land

Our industrial plant is built; the problem just now is whether under existing conditions it is not overbuilt. Our last frontier has long since been reached, and there is practically no more free land. . .

Talks about third generation DDR, and expanding DDR to incorporate ASANs
Introduction 1990&rsquo;s DDR was largely used to deal with statutory and insurgent armies following peace accords miltias and ASNAs have grown in recent years DDR concept has increasingly been reconfigured to support deal with armed groups without a negotiated peace accord deal with situations of violence as well as a range of armed actors that control or influence population without being a part of peace negotiations or under direct state control Stretching and blurring of DDR concept to adapt to changing contexts of violence called &lsquo;second generation ddr&rsquo; includes effords to disarm and dismantle militias (ddm) and flexible sequencing, placing reintegration before others (RDD) argues that the traditional DDR concepts might have to be abandoned to understand this new world DDR and ASANs DDR remains the default template to understand challenges of armed conflicts
number of people eligible for DDR benefits has grown, reflecting the problems of sharp distinctions between combantants and civilians
programs comprise an ever-expanding field of interventions, such as access to land, cash transfers, and employment, and, as described in relation to the second generation of DDR, additional measures of area-based trust-building and weapons control have complemented the core of the DDR template
people are still interested in DDR as a template
sustained focus on technical assistance, knowledge management, and adaptation to new strategic challenges experience shows that DDR fails to meet its aims in many areas, such as the central african republic
Assumptions about Demobilization and Disarmament of ANSAs because of the variation among ANSAs, it does not make sense to treat them in any uniform way. Due to the general idea that the state is defined by its monopoly on violence, armed non-state actors have usually been seen as diametrically opposed to stability and statehood.
ANSAs can be double edged swords in that they are sources of security as well as insecurity, and have potentially construction as well as destructive effects in processess of state building and peacebuilding.
highlights how important it is that giving up arms is not seen as surrendering international security assistance force in afghanistan mention that fighters removed from the battlefield it is critical that reintegration is never seen or profiled to them as an act of &ldquo;surrender&rdquo; the terms &ldquo;surrender&rdquo; and &ldquo;laying down weapons&rdquo; should never be used in any conversation, discussion, or reference myanmar has this problem as well states that afghanistan, libya, syria, and iraq will mean bypassing the standard DDR templates and focussing instead on short term power agreements I disagree with this, this replicates the issues of taif agreement and potentially hinders the state from reemerging in any real capacity suggests that ANSAs might be more like gangs although we shouldn&rsquo;t take too many lessons from war on gangs but &ldquo;organic&rdquo; membership transition away from gangs and back into society may be useful uganda militias fizzeled pretty quickly after formation, perhaps we can just let it ride? many actions compel public authorities to act, although many may just fizzle out Assumptions about reintegration challenges 3 assumed that combtants are removed from their communities when they are mobilized and should return to where they lived before and that they need special reintegration arrangements demobilization is assumed to break links between command and control, so reintegration is seen differently friendship relations may not necessarily break
as Knight (2008) has argued), DDR should be viewed as a continuation of the political dialogue, entailed in peace talks, and that specialized and focused forms of assistance should be conceived of to enable the transofrmation of the organization of (in this case insurgent) armed groups.
Reintegration aims to reduce the causes and liklihood of remobilization by reducing the economic motivation progams use employment and improved livelihood this assumes everyone is a rational actor, civil war has a way of making things irrational need to avoid reintegration back into poverty training needs to actually match demand un policy for post-conflict employment creation, income, generation, and reintegration talks about keeping youth off the streets somewhat of a gendered dynamic here actually very few empircal evidence to link unemployment, underemployment, or low-productivity employment to violence and war reintegration is a political process!!! cannot be conceived purely as an economic one Conclusion little evidence that DDR programs produce all their desired outcomes DDR focuses on outputs and not outcomes some amount of mission creep has occured in ddr `}),e.add({id:1077,href:"/posts/muqtada_al_sadr/",title:"Muqtada al-Sadr",content:`Tags: iraq

Religion is only interesting as a impairs or propels the formation of nationalism Miroslav Hroch does not dedicate much time to this either The French Revolution brought Christianity down from heaven to earth - pg 4 Does sectarianism raise it back up? Questions - pg 5 Is nationalism the result of the decline of religion? Or did it emerge during intensive religious feelings Is nationalism shaped by Christianity inherently? Is nationalism intrinsically secular or intrinsically religious? Is nationalism the religion of modernity, or is it a subsitute for religion, or a functional equivilant? Voicu - only dominant religions affect nationalist beliefs Brubaker proposes 4 ways to study - pg 7 Treat both religion and nationalism as analogous phoneoma Treat religion as a cause or explanation of nationalism Treat religion intertwined with nationalism Treat religious nationalism as totally distinctive from other kinds of nationalism All these serve to expand the framework of the 3 layers proposed by Hinnebusch - Identity and State Formation in Multi‐sectarian Societies Some states consider religious diversity as a marker for their national distinctiveness Soeren Keil on Bosnia-Herzegovina Chapter 2 - Governments and Gods Two forms

Weber defines ethnic groups as &ldquo;human groups that entertain a subjective belief in their common descent&rdquo;
Nations have a purpose, ethnic groups exist:
Nations are political collectives, they have institutions of political self-government or are politically mobilized to achieve national self-determination. Ethic groups, by contrast, need not seek self-government - once they do, they are nationalizing themselves.
pg 18 Accept that erligion as a belief and practices that are socially constructed
3 types of religious conflict - pg 20
conflicts between different religions conflicts within the same religions conflicts between religious and non-religious Regulating religious differences has a few ways
Eliminating religious differences completely Genocide, ethnic cleansing, etc Extremely costly and sanctioned against on the international stage Assimilation and integration Coercive ethnic assimation follows the same style Government sponsorship of religion Wide spectrum Partition Partition into various religious and ethnic states Managing religious differences has a few ways as well:
Control Organize the dominant religion, disorganize the subordinate ones Offical or established religions Arbitration Sultan, king, high represenative in Bosnia, etc Someone deemed to be sufficiently impartial Constitutional courts? Non-existant in Iraq Accomodation Consociation Lebanon, Iraq Can exasterbate sectarian lines Iraq constitution does not expressly define religion or the bill of rights as part of the exclusive powers of the federal gov, although Islam is the offical religion of the federation - pg 29
Chapter 6 - Religious pluralism and multinational federalism in bosnia and Herzegovina Federal system has not resulted in a stable state - pg 81 Territorial units are mono-ethic, little exchange between people Americans saw the Bosnia conflict as national groups fighting over the same territory Conflict was a question about what Bosnia is, nature of the state, relationship between Bosniaks, Serbs, and Croats Dayton Accords extremely complex and decentralized 3 presidents
Substantial veto rights reserved based on group and entity concerns
High represenative getting powerful intervention rights due to deadlocks caused it to become a major example of international state-building - pg 85
Absurdity of the system:
Bosnia-Herzegovina is absurd. If the international community always supports the high represenative and not the institutions of Bosnia-Herzegovina, then it doesn&rsquo;t matter if I am the head of state or Bart Simpson
pg 86 Undemocratic nature of the high represenative
Serbs have irrendentalist ideas and possibly want to merge back into Serbia Also currently support the Dayton Agreement because the RS is granted substantial autonomy Croats think the FBiH discriminates against the Croats by lumping them together with the Bosinaks Croats do not question the territorial integrity of Bosnia due to lack of support from Croatia&rsquo;s politicians - pg 88 Bosniaks are unhappy because the state is unmanageable Leading bishops in Bosnia and Croatia asked all Catholics to identify as &ldquo;Croat&rdquo; - pg 89 Similarities of KRG/iraqi kurdistan to the RS? `}),e.add({id:1091,href:"/posts/nahjul_balaghah/",title:"nahjul balaghah",content:`Tags: people, islam

Question 1 How can we understand the scope of nationalism today: as an ideology, community, political formation, legal entity, etc. In what ways nationalism continues to be important in the Middle East? This question is based on our readings during the ﬁrst week, and as an overarching theme. You are encouraged to discuss historical or contemporary case studies from the Middle East. Outline Notions of nationalism contribute to the strife percieved in the middle east Primordial nationalists believe that there is a fundalmental primordial cause to the sectarianism Nationalism affects the middle east by both the views imposed on it from an outside powers, but also shapes the middle east via capitalistic lens It shapes the goals of nations and their political futures Iraq&rsquo;s roundabout with prime ministers that are satisfactorially Iranian and western friendly Nationalism from within Nationalism as an symbolism/socialpolitical movement Palestine, Kurds Emphasis on cultural gestation Nationalism as a legal entity (as a doctrine of the nation/ideaology) Lebanon, Iraq Nationalism from outside Primordialism Centrality of states Nationalism as engagement with international law Similar to the ottoman states engaging with international law in the ottoman twilight period, engagement with international law is a goal for nationalism, in effect having their lack &ldquo;non-nation&rdquo; state recongized among peers Draft outline What is nationalism?
In the middle east we should see nationalism as two categories: traditional nationalism deriving from the nation-states within the middle east
Smith defines it as ethnic symbolism/socialpoltiical movements/doctrine of And nationalism as circumscribed by the empires of the outside world
Chatterjee defines it within the contexts of empries and nation-states Both are correct, and we can view the middle east today as a combination of these factors, the nationalism as a language ethnic symbol, as a social-poltiical movement, doctrine of idealology,
Traditional nationalism should be defined in terms of
language/ethnic symbolism aka populism aka ideaology Syria (the extra bit of iskanderun in the flag of SDF) Bidoon within the middle east Comoros passport program for bidoon within the UAE socialpolitical movements Palestine, Kurds, Ahwazi Arabs legal entity (doctrine of nation/ideaology) Lebanon, Iraq Nationalism of the empire
American/European nationalism as the head of the World Bank/IMF Dollarization as a loss of nationalism As the nation state has tied itself with capital, capital has rid itself of the trappings of the nation-state, the new battleground is over oil OPEC is long dead, saudi&rsquo;s hold power in concert with Russia and the US Draft Nationalism today must be defined within the Middle East as two broad components: a more &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; inner component derived from the nation-state, and another outer component derived from the modern empires of the world. Anthony Smith defines nationalism as &ldquo;language and symbolism, a sociopolitical movement and an ideology of the nation&rdquo;. This is the first component easily observable within the Middle East, contemporary nations within the region offer a wide range of examples speaking to each aspect that Smith describes. However, a second, less observable component is described by Chaterjee, who puts forward the notion that empires today, although they lack explict annexation and overt repression, impose their own forms of nationalism onto the region.
To first look at the observable aspects of nationalism within the region, one can easily find abundant examples of the three aspects Smith describes. One example of the symbolism of nationalism can be found within Syria. The boundaries of the Syrian Arab Republic were drawn as part of the French Syrian mandate, partitioning out the modern Lebanese state and several atonomous regions, such as the Druze state and the Sanjak of Alexandritta. However, while the modern Lebanese state is formally recongized by the Syrian state as an indenpendent nation today, and the Druze and Alawaite states were absorbed back into Syria, it is notable that the Sanjak of Alexandritta eventually transitioned into the Hatay State for one year under League of Nations supervision, then abosred into the Turkish state as the Hatay province following a referrendum. Modern Syria still holds this referredum as illegiatemate, and the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) still depicts Hatay provicine as part of Syria within its flag today. This commonality between the Syrian state and the SDF, with one side going as far as to depict it upon a flag denotes a special quality to the concept of a Syrian nation and provides a guidepost towards irredentialist conceptions.
Socialpolitical movements within the Middle East are the most visible aspects of nationalism within the region. As socialpolitical movements within the context of nationalism specifically emphasises cultural gestation and representation (Smith 6), the issues of Palestine and Kurdish independence are both representative. Both groups are circumscribed both legally and culturally. Palestinians living in Jordan are allowed to travel to the Palestinian territories, while Jordanians are not, but certain conditions bar Palestinians living in Jordan from acquiring a Jordanian passport. In the case of Kurds, a patchwork of legal rules carve up the definition of Kurds, from the de facto independence in Syria, outright repression within Turkey, and state-granted autonomy within Iraq and Iran. By mostly formalizing these ethnic categories into law, states within the Middle East perform segregative biopolitics in order to contain and control nationalist ideaologies.
The final aspect of Smith&rsquo;s definition of nationalism is nationalism as a legal entity, which can be seen in both Lebanon and Iraq. Lebanon&rsquo;s taif system, and Iraq&rsquo;s unwritten-but-similar system of carving up political roles between factions is the purest form of nationalism, the act of agreeing on a fundalmental nation-state to carve up and between factions is itself a veneration of the nation-state idea. This must be distinguised from the cases of Palestine and Kurds brought up in relation to socialpolitical movements. In the case of Palestine and Kurds, the nation-state act as an oppressor, while in the case of Lebanon and Iraq, the status of factions is formalized in legal or normative rulings.
Nationalism within the Middle East is not solely confined to within the nations. Chatterjee has shown, the binding of capitalism and the nation-state have worked in concert to formalize both. Yet, as capitalism and the flow of capital itself has grown, it has allowed empires to continue within the space of capital. Modern imperialism within the Middle East is not preoccupied with the explicit annexation of territory or people, but rather interested in the control and usage of capital. The International Monetary Fund&rsquo;s (IMF) loan to Egypt in 2016 in exchange for structural adjustments, as well as Lebanon&rsquo;s peg of the Lebanese Lira to the US Dollar are both examples of a foriegn nationalism.
Question 2 How did colonialism shape nationalist thought and the formation of nation-states in the Middle East. What were diﬀerent forms of colonial rule implemented in the region and what were their repercussions on the emergence of nationalist thought and movements. Discuss one case in depth or provide a layout of a number of diﬀerent cases. This question is based our discussions of the Midde East during WWI and in between wars. Please feel free to bring other readings, your area of interest into the discussion here. Iraq
Necropolitics by RAF bombings Sati al-Husri&rsquo;s reformations lead to a generation of &ldquo;iraqi&rdquo; nationalist thought and territoritial integerity Treaty of Ankara gave mosul to iraq Kurdish and Assyrian fears of a unified Iraqi state against independence and admittance to the league of nations Timelines British usage of necropolitics and a top down administration, combined with Sati Husri&rsquo;s reforms, and paying off shaikys and movement of shi&rsquo;a in iraq lead to Kurdish revolts in the 1920&rsquo;s Assyrian revolt in 1933 Nationalism integrated via conscription Post independence shi&rsquo;i opposition to conscription - British colonialism, treaties and explotition of resources within Iraq during the mandate era and interwar period lead to the outpouring of nationalism movements for the Kurdish, Assyrian, Shia, and Jewish populations. These revolts, in turn, forced the government into a series of top down actions in order to broaden national solidarity and attempt to build a nationalist ideaology, as well as the gradual marginalization of shi'as from power. Draft The reprecussions of colonialism within the Middle East is most apparent within the context of the Iraqi state. Dogged by the &ldquo;artifical state&rdquo; narrative within modern literature, Iraq contiunes to show the impacts of colonial legacy, especially in the development of Iraqi nationalism. British colonialism, treatings and exploitation of resources within Iraq during the mandate era and the interwar period lead to the outpouring of nationalism for minorities, as well as gestated the concept of a greater Iraqi nationalism.
Nationalism must be defined carefully when talking about Iraq, as the narrative of an &ldquo;artificial Iraqi state&rdquo; lingers over debates about Iraq today. The logic of an artificial state is one intwertwined with the notion of an &ldquo;ethnic&rdquo; state, where an ethic state comprised of a single ethnicity is merely the realization of ethnosymbolism. This state is percieved as &ldquo;natural&rdquo;, in diametric opposition to the &ldquo;artifical&rdquo; state, which is comprised of hetreogenous groups that act with their own agencies. For historical reasons, the &ldquo;artifical state&rdquo; narrative is a useful one, as it provided justification for the British mandate, stating that a young artificial state required tutalge before becoming a full-fleged state. It must be noted, however, that the development of Iraq at the start of the mandate rivaled the development of the Balkan states, but Balkan states never had to be placed under tutalge.
Furthermore, the idea of an artifical state requires the assumption that the sects within Iraq and transtemporal and unchanging, harkening back to the concepts of primordialism. Kurds, Sunni, Shia, Armenian, Jewish populations must be held to be coherent wholes struggling against one another. In other words, the British practice of segregative biopolitics and necropolitics, combined with the imposition of an artifical state, combined to generate a feedback loop encouraging the sectarian nature of Iraq today.
British colonial policy during the Iraqi mandate towards minorities was either co-option or necropolitics. Gertrude Bell famously commented that Iraqi should remain an agricultural country &ldquo;forever&rdquo;, with intense focus on control of Iraq&rsquo;s oil wealth. As a result, mandatory Iraq was mostly run through the Royal Air Force, which proceeded to conduct intense air bombings in order to pacify a rural population, such as the case of the revolt in 1920. The revolt, which was predominately Shia, was violently put down by the British in support of a Sunni government. Assyrians, who were protected by the British until 1932, leading to greater Iraqi society perciving them as a privelaged class. Due to this explict patronage, when the British left, Bakr Sidiqi was able to organize a popular campaign resulting in a massacre of Assyrians. British mandatory and colonial policies, geared towards management of the Iraqi populace by pitting different groups together, sowed the seeds of sectarian based violence and nationalism based on ethnicity.
Sara Pursely&rsquo;s work on segreative biopolitics of gender and masculinity must be noted here. Pursely describes how Sati al-Husri recongized the colonial mentality of eduction, based on the false psychological theory of the unconcious (Familiar Futures, 72). In this respect, colonialism shaped al-Husri&rsquo;s views by standing in opposition to his later policies, where al-Husri promoted a more egalatarian and inclusive education system, starting by standardizing the core circulum between boys/girls and urban/rural areas. The British mandatory policy of leaving the Iraqi Ministry of Education to its own devices actually allowed al-Husri to promote his views on pan-Arabism.
However, even as Iraq gained independence in 1932 with the retreat of the British to specific, treaty bound terms,colonialism did not disappear from Iraq. The Monroe Report, which was generated by a group of educators from the Columbia Teacher&rsquo;s College during a visit to Iraq, faulted the Ministry of Education for the standarized system of education between boys/girls and urban/rural. Even as one colonial power began to fade, American-style teaching, based on the Tuskgeegee model (Pursely 87) of &ldquo;learning by doing&rdquo; and &ldquo;adapted education&rdquo; (Pursely 79) clambered up to the still warm colonial seat. While American influences are not &ldquo;colonialism&rdquo; in the strict sense, the influence of the Monroe Report was reminisinct of colonial policies in that it attempted to lift policies geared towards suppression of minorities within the United States and apply them in Iraq. As a result of the Monroe Report and educated elite who had studied at the Teacher&rsquo;s College, the Ministry of Education began to dismantle some of al-Husri&rsquo;s policies of standarization, such as providing more focus on home economics for girls and focusing school circulums on encouring and generating sexual differences. As British indirect rule receded, American influences grew in education policy.
Talk about Sati Al-Husri - Makdisi - The Ecumenical Frame Talk about the kurdish, assyrian revolts, conscription Talk about how all this, combined with the british buying off tribes and encouraging the faisal administration to pare with tribes and deal with shaykhs leads to the feedback loop Yassine al Hashimi and the formation of the Iraqi communist party and the revolt Britsh belief in primordialism makes it so that they fed into the sectarianism Question 3 Anderson - Imagined Communities
Explain Anderson’s theory of nations as “imagined communities”. Based on the examples we discussed in class, do you see a similar historical trajectory for nation-formations in the Middle East? To what extent Anderson’s theoretical constructs apply to the case of the Middle East? (Make sure to discuss Chatterjee’s critique of Anderson here also)
What is an imagined community?
Iraq and language
Turkey and Kemalism and comparisons to using ottoman era power levers Meeker - A Nation of Empire
Egypt and al-Azhar -&gt; Hassan - Longing for the Lost Caliphate
Blumi
Madisi and the collapse of the ecunmenical frame
Draft Anderson&rsquo;s theory of nations as &ldquo;imagined communities&rdquo; predominately revolves around the notion that all nations are imagined, as it is impossible for all citizens within modern nations to meet one another, but is a shared nevertheless. The nation, Anderson claims, is one that is founded on ethnolinguistic lines, with emphasis on a shared common langauge, and socially constructed. It is a modern concept accelerated into existance by decentralization of power, print capitalism, and the standarization of language. Imagined communities seem to apply broadly at first blush to the Middle East, such as the case of pan-Arabism and Turkey, but as Chaterjee and other sources show, the concept of an imagined community is not enough to understand the events of the Middle East.
The standout example of Anderson&rsquo;s theory is Sati al-Husri and his concept of Pan-Arabism. Husri&rsquo;s promotion of a pan-Arab identity, one that transcends religion by emphaizising the commonality of language between Iraqi Sunnis, Shias, Jews, and Christians through the promotion of a standardized education system and spread of literacy is almost a direct act of Anderson&rsquo;s theory. Even the exclusion of Kurds in al-Husri&rsquo;s policies aligns with Anderson&rsquo;s theory, Anderson describes the &ldquo;elastic boundaries&rdquo; of nations, which accurately describes the status of the Kurds between the beginning of the Iraqi mandate to the Treaty of Ankara, to the formal independence of Iraq in 1932.
Chaterjee&rsquo;s central critque of Anderson revolves around the fact that there &ldquo;imagined communities&rdquo; is a terminal destination. In eliding nationalism and political movements together, it ignores that the borders of post-colonial states were largely drawn by colonial powers and reduces the agency of post-colonial states themselves.
Does not describe why &ldquo;the imagined community of sufi pilgrims did not constitute a nation&rdquo;. Does not describe Drita in Blumi&rsquo;s readings.
Question 4 Many of our class readings discussed the centrality of outsiders in the formation of nationalism. The example of Kashmir, Palestine and the Kurdish Middle East, as well as Simon’s discussion of Iraqi nationalism and Adar’s discussion of emotions around the Armenian Genocide were all reminders of how historical and contemporary processes of deciding on and ruling the outsider populations are critical to develop a nationalist imaginary. Based on these case studies, as well as the other contexts you may be familiar with, discuss the role of outsiders in the construction of national identity and nationalist imaginary.
Role of outsiders Define an outsider, is an Ottoman an outsider?, from Provonce - The Last Ottoman Generation Shared historical, primordial history often grasped for as a tool in the case of Iraq and Turkey Iraq - Simon - Imposition of Nationalism on Non-Nation State In Iraq, religion was bypassed in order to build a shared national identity and nationalist imaginary. Jews, Shias, and Sunni&rsquo;s were the same &ldquo;arab&rdquo; Conscription as a form of nationalist unity Khalifat movement shaped views of unity of the caliphate
Ahmed - Afghanistan Rising and Turkish policy, CUP people
Turkish policies defined who is a Turk, pan-Islamism was used opposite of Iraq in order to build an identity Shutting down of Sufi lodges
Sufi lodges used to be a sign of the caliphate&rsquo;s spiritual power and authority, when Ataturk shut them down this was an explicit carving out of an outgroup in order to build a shared Turkish identity Adar - Emotions and Nationalism: Armenian Genocide as a Case Study
Conflict as essential, same with Kurds? Aciksoz - Sacrificial Limbs of Soverignty Population exchange in Turkey and Greece with Humanism in Ruins - Discussion Questions Refugees in the western balkans have shown us how itenerant groups can distrupt social structures from Blumi - Ottoman Refugees, 1878-1939 Draft Outsiders play a vital role in the shaping of Middle East identities, and in turn, the nationalisms that arose. However, to fully discuss this role, the definition of an &ldquo;outsider&rdquo; within the context of the Middle East must be carefully defined. If an &ldquo;outsider&rdquo; is simply defined as a privilaged class, typically based on ethnolinguistic lines, existing within a bounded state, then the concept of an &ldquo;outsider&rdquo; is simply inherited from the colonial and mandate eras. This is apparent within Simon&rsquo;s discussion of Iraqi nationalism, wherein he describes Iraqi nationalism strictly in terms of ethnic and linguistic groups in contrast to the Iraqi Sunnis. Simon&rsquo;s discussion focuses on the plight of the Iraqi Kurds, who longed for their own nation, Iraqi Shia&rsquo;s, who comprised a plurality of the population but were deprived porportional representation within the state due to the British demand for a Sunni monarch, Iraqi Jews, whose communities were decimated due to factors outside their control, and the Assyrians, a British patroned group that suffered horrific reprisals as the British retreated. While it is appealing to carve up the insider/outsider paradigm based on the patronage lines of colonial powers, this framing is fundalmentally limited in scope. Patronage lines were based on ethnolinguistic lines, and ethnolinguistic lines presuppose the existance of a permanent, unchanging sectarian identities, almost always tied to specific locations. To understand how outsiders affect nationalism and national identities within the Middle East, I believe it is necessary to expand the framing of who is an outsider. Outsiders are groups that are transtemporal as well as transpatial, outsiders can be born of a different time period as well as belonging to separate groups. The examples of the last Ottoman generation of officiers, who held a vital role in the shaping of mandate states, placed alongside Armenians, Kurds, and Iraqi show how outsiders shaped various states in idiosycratic ways. The notion of a secular Iraqi state buttressed on sectarian lines arise from the early mandate era, and the existance of an unwritten sect-based state in Iraq today is a direct result of this. Turkish identity is based upon a strong cultural identity and a weak judicial one, leading to the paradox of &ldquo;privilage&rdquo; that Adar describes. Yassine al-Hashimi&rsquo;s role in the construction of Iraqi nationalism cannot be understated. The work of Michael Provonce shows us how al-Hashimi deftly understood the power structures being built by the British to rule Iraq. Although born in Baghdad, al-Hashimi was a member of the last generation of Ottoman sons, and studied at the elite general staff college during the Ottoman twilight years, where he (secretly) became a member of the CUP. During Mustafa Kemal&rsquo;s consolidation of power within Anatolia, al-Hashimi requested to return to Iraq after the coronation of Faiysal (Provonce, 137), which, although he was originally born in the city, al-Hashimi was an outsider for having been absent over two decades. His later vocal criticisms of Faiysal based on disagreements about the level of cooperation with the British lead him to be a member of the &ldquo;opposition&rdquo;. Faiysal&rsquo;s pattern of temporarily appointing al-Hashimi prime minister in order to satisfy Iraqis shows how Iraqi nationalism is based on a rotating cast of power, that compromise is spurned for handouts to certain populations via a spoils system. Reconciliation between various groups in Iraq were not managed by developing true dialogue or &ldquo;big tent&rdquo; groups, but rather a management of fustration and anger among various groups. This bears remarkable similarity to the modern Iraqi political system, where prime minsterial candidates require the assent of US-aligned and Iran-aligned groups, and certain ministries are divided between them, while important ministries such as the oil ministry are left to the hands of technocrats. No true dialogue exists between these various groups, rather national identity itself is premised upon carving up the spoils of the state. Outsiders helped define the boundaries of the early Turkish republic as well, thereby creating the modern Turkish nationalist imaginary. The percieved privleaged position Armenians in the modern Turkish republic (Adar) is a sign of this, while Turkish citizenship is defined as anyone who had lived within Anatolia during the formation of the state, to be a Turk, culturally speaking, is drawn on far more strict lines. Adar talks about how an MP stated that &ldquo;authentic citizens belongs to the Hanefi sect of Sunni Islam and speaks Turkish&rdquo;. This line neatly cleaves out Armenians and Kurds from &ldquo;authentic citizenship&rdquo;, providing a root for a nationalist imaginary, distinct from the legal definitions. Yet the differences between the definition of a Turk in Turkish law and culture also serve to make Turkish identity somewhat malleable. If an Armenian publicly and routinely pledges loyalty to the state, they are considered &ldquo;privileaged&rdquo; (Adar 743), as they have effectively leveraged their legal status as a Turkish citizen to join the cultural group of &ldquo;Turks&rdquo;. Furthermore, the Turkish cultural identity can be leveraged to change the legal status as well. The work of Faiz Ahmed in describing the close contact of ex-CUP officers in Afghanistan to the Turkish state displays this, ultimately with Afghanistan under Aman Allah becoming the first nation to recongize the newly created Turkish Republic, all stemming from broad pan-Islamic lines. The powers of these bonds held even after Kemal formally abolished the caliphate. The grey zone created by a distinction of law and culture with regards to Turkish identity provided ample space for the construction of a strong nationalist identity, as it clearly delinated the outsiders while providing enough room to absorb others under its aegis.
Turkish kurds give the turkish groups something to unite on CUP people in afghanistan Khalifat movement consolidates kemal&rsquo;s power by giving him money to build a state then passing it on Turkish aermenians are privlaged, but not privleaged `}),e.add({id:1103,href:"/posts/20200418212315-nationalism_and_outsiders_in_the_middle_east_midterm_final/",title:"Nationalism and Outsiders in the Middle East - Midterm Final",content:`Tags: Nationalism and Outsiders in the Middle East - Midterm Draft
Question 1 Nationalism today must be defined within the Middle East as two broad components: a more &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; inner component derived from the nation-state, and another outer component derived from the modern empires of the world. Anthony Smith defines nationalism as &ldquo;language and symbolism, a sociopolitical movement and an ideology of the nation&rsquo;&rsquo; (Smith, 7). The component is easily observable within the Middle East, as contemporary nations within the region offer a wide range of examples speaking to each aspect that Smith describes. However, a second less observable component is described by Chaterjee, who puts forward the notion that empires today, although they lack explicit annexation and overt repression, impose their own forms of nationalism onto the region. To first look at the observable aspects of nationalism within the region, one can easily find abundant examples of the three aspects Smith describes. One example of the symbolism of nationalism can be found within Syria. The boundaries of the Syrian Arab Republic were drawn as part of the French Syrian mandate, partitioning out the modern Lebanese state and several autonomous regions, such as the Druze state and the Sanjak of Alexandretta. However, while the modern Lebanese state is formally recognized by the Syrian state as an independent nation today, and the Druze and Alawite states were absorbed back into Syria, it is notable that the Sanjak of Alexandretta eventually transitioned into the Hatay State for one year under League of Nations supervision, then absorbed into the Turkish state as the Hatay province following a referendum. Modern Syria still holds this referendum as illegitimate, and the Syrian Democratic Forces still depicts Hatay province as part of Syria within its flag today. This commonality between the Syrian state and the SDF, with one side going as far as to depict it upon a flag, denotes a special quality to the nature of a Syrian nation and provides a guidepost towards irredentialist conceptions. With the SDF flag as an explicit symbol, the agreement between two warring factions on the boundaries of Syria is a textbook example of Smith&rsquo;s conception of nationalism. Socialpolitical movements within the Middle East are the most visible aspects of nationalism within the region. As these movements specifically emphasize cultural gestation and representation (Smith 6), the issues of Palestine and Kurdish independence are both representative here. Both groups are circumscribed both legally and culturally. Palestinians living in Jordan, for example, are allowed to travel to the Palestinian territories, while Jordanians are not, but certain conditions bar Palestinians living in Jordan from acquiring a Jordanian passport. In the case of Kurds, a patchwork of laws spread across four nations carved up the definition of Kurds, from the de facto independence in Syria, outright repression within Turkey, and state-granted autonomy within Iraq and Iran. By mostly formalizing these ethnic categories into law, states within the Middle East perform segregative biopolitics via passport control in order to contain and control nationalist ideologies. The auspices of the modern nation-state&rsquo;s boundaries act as a buffer on nationalism within the Palestinian and Kurdish groups. The final aspect of Smith&rsquo;s definition of nationalism is nationalism as a legal entity, which places the nation-state at the center as both a sovereign to be obeyed and spoils to be captured. Lebanon and Iraq are clear examples here. Lebanon&rsquo;s taif system, and Iraq&rsquo;s unwritten-but-similar system of carving up political roles between factions is exactly representative of this, the Lebanese and Iraqi states both maintain that they are the only source of legitimate violence, but different roles are split among factions for patronage purposes. The act of agreeing on the boundaries of a nation-state to carve up is itself a veneration of the nation-state idea. This must be distinguished from the cases of Palestine and Kurds brought up in relation to social political movements. In the case of Palestine and Kurds, the nation-state acts as an oppressor, while in the case of Lebanon and Iraq, the status of factions is formalized in legal or normative rulings. Nationalism within the Middle East is not solely confined to within the nations. Chatterjee has shown that the binding of capitalism and the nation-state have worked in tandem to formalize both. Yet, as capitalism and the flow of capital itself has grown, it has allowed empires to continue within the space of capital. Modern imperialism within the Middle East is not preoccupied with the explicit annexation of territory or people, but rather interested in the control and usage of capital. The International Monetary Fund&rsquo;s loan to Egypt in 2016 in exchange for structural adjustments, as well as Lebanon&rsquo;s peg of the Lebanese Lira to the US Dollar are both examples of a foriegn nationalism. Both countries have ceded sovereign control of their currency to either an international organization in the case of Egypt, or another country in the case of Lebanon. Nationalism continues to be important in providing a rallying point against these acts of sovereign capture.
Question 2 The repercussions of colonialism within the Middle East is most apparent within the context of the Iraqi state. Dogged by the &ldquo;artificial state&rdquo; narrative within modern literature, Iraq continues to show the impacts of colonial legacy, especially in the development of Iraqi nationalism. British colonialism, the treatment and exploitation of resources within Iraq during the mandate era and the interwar period lead to the outpouring of political movements from minorities, as well as gestated the concept of a greater Iraqi nationalism. Nationalism must be defined carefully when talking about Iraq. The logic of an artificial state is one intertwined with the notion of an &ldquo;ethnic&rdquo; state, where an ethic state comprised of a single ethnicity is the realization of ethnosymbolism. This state is perceived as &ldquo;natural&rdquo;, in diametric opposition to the &ldquo;artificial&rdquo; state, which is composed of heterogeneous groups that act with their own agencies. For historical reasons, the &ldquo;artificial state&rdquo; narrative is a useful one, as it provided justification for the British mandate, stating that a young &ldquo;artificial&rdquo; state required tutelage before maturation onto the world stage. It must be noted, however, that the development of Iraq at the start of the mandate rivaled the development of the Balkan states, but yet there was no concept of a mandate for the Balkan states (Anscombe, 152). Furthermore, the idea of an artificial state requires the assumption that the groups and sects within Iraq are transtemporal and unchanging, harkening back to the concepts of primordialism. Kurds, Sunni, Shia, Armenian, Jewish populations must be held to be coherent wholes struggling against one another, yet also these identifications are expected to always have remained and to always remain. In other words, the British practice of patronage across ethnic lines, combined with the imposition of an &ldquo;artificial&rdquo; state narrative, combined to generate a feedback loop encouraging the sectarian nature of Iraq today. Benedict Anderson even remarks upon this by stating that the concept of an &ldquo;imagined community&rdquo; requires groups to conceptualize a homogenous time (Pursely, 13). British colonial policy during the Iraqi mandate towards minorities was either co-option or necropolitics. Gertrude Bell famously commented that Iraqi should remain an agricultural country &ldquo;forever&rdquo;, with intense focus on control of Iraq&rsquo;s oil wealth (Pursely, 35). As a result, mandatory Iraq was mostly run through the Royal Air Force, which proceeded to conduct intense air bombings in order to pacify a rural population, such as the case of the revolt in 1920. The revolt, which was predominantly Shia, was violently put down by the British in support of a Sunni government. Assyrians, who were protected by the British until 1932, leading to greater Iraqi society perceiving them as a privileged class (Simon, 93). Due to this explicit patronage, when the British left, Bakr Sidiqi was able to organize a popular campaign resulting in a massacre of Assyrians. British mandatory and colonial policies, geared towards management of the Iraqi populace by pitting different groups together, sowed the seeds of sectarian based violence and nationalism based on ethnicity. Sara Pursely&rsquo;s work on segreative biopolitics of gender and masculinity must be noted here. Pursely describes how Sati al-Husri recognized the colonial mentality of education, based on the false psychological theory of the unconscious (72). In this respect, colonialism shaped al-Husri&rsquo;s views by standing in opposition to his later policies, where al-Husri promoted a more egalitarian and inclusive education system, starting by standardizing the core curriculum between boys/girls and urban/rural areas. The British mandatory policy of leaving the Iraqi Ministry of Education to its own devices actually allowed al-Husri to promote his views on pan-Arabism.
However, even as Iraq gained independence in 1932 with the retreat of the British to specific, treaty bound terms, colonialism did not disappear from Iraq. The Monroe Report, which was generated by a group of educators from the Columbia Teachers College during a visit to Iraq, faulted the Ministry of Education for the standardized system of education between boys/girls and urban/rural. Even as one colonial power began to fade, American-style teaching, based on the Tuskegee model (Pursley 87) of &ldquo;learning by doing&rdquo; and &ldquo;adapted education&rdquo; (Pursley 79) clambered up to the still warm colonial seat. While American influences are not &ldquo;colonialism&rdquo; in the strict sense, the influence of the Monroe Report was reminiscent of colonial policies in that it attempted to lift policies geared towards suppression of minorities within the United States and apply them in Iraq. As a result of the Monroe Report and the educated elite who had studied at the Teacher&rsquo;s College, the Ministry of Education began to dismantle some of al-Husri&rsquo;s policies of standardization, such as providing more focus on home economics for girls and focusing school curriculums on encouraging and generating sexual differences. As British indirect rule receded, American influences grew in education policy. The context of colonialism via capitalistic terms continued in Iraq for quite some time, such as with the Dujayla land project. Overall, colonial rule first via the British then the Americans through international organizations shaped a narrative around the Iraqi state, as well fed into the notions of sect, pushing them more towards ethnosymbolism.
Question 3 Anderson&rsquo;s theory of nations as &ldquo;imagined communities&rdquo; predominately revolves around the notion that all nations are imagined, as it is impossible for all citizens within modern nations to meet one another, but is shared nevertheless. The nation, Anderson claims, is one that is founded on ethnolinguistic lines, with emphasis on a shared common language, and socially constructed within the context of a perceived homogenous time frame. It is a modern concept accelerated into existence by decentralization of power, print capitalism, and the standardization of language. Imagined communities seem to apply broadly at first blush to the Middle East, such as the case of pan-Arabism and Turkey, but as Chaterjee and other sources show, the concept of an imagined community is not enough to understand the events of the Middle East. The standout example of Anderson&rsquo;s theory is Sati al-Husri and his concept of Pan-Arabism. Husri&rsquo;s promotion of a pan-Arab identity, one that transcends religion by emphasizing the commonality of language between Iraqi Sunnis, Shias, Jews, and Christians through the promotion of a standardized education system and spread of literacy is almost a direct act of Anderson&rsquo;s theory. Even the exclusion of Kurds in al-Husri&rsquo;s policies aligns with Anderson&rsquo;s theory, Anderson describes the &ldquo;elastic boundaries&rdquo; of nations, which accurately describes the status of the Kurds between the beginning of the Iraqi mandate to the Treaty of Ankara, to the formal independence of Iraq in 1932. Chaterjee&rsquo;s central critique of Anderson revolves around the fact that there &ldquo;imagined communities&rdquo; is a terminal destination. In eliding nationalism and political movements together, it ignores that the borders of post-colonial states were largely drawn by colonial powers and reduces the agency of post-colonial states themselves, claiming that &ldquo;even our imaginations must remain forever colonized&rdquo; (Chaterjee, 5). The work of Lale Can with regards to Central Asian pilgrims during the late Ottoman era is an example. The debates within the Ottoman empire with regards to the naturalization of these pilgrims pushes the boundaries that Anderson describes. Even as these pilgrims brought into the idea of print capitalism and perceived themselves within a singular time frame in concert with the Ottoman Empire, the Ottoman Empire attempted to put up various legal roadblocks in order to prevent their naturalization (Can, 151). Even as these pilgrims fulfill the criteria Anderson puts out, the theory of &ldquo;imagined communities&rdquo; is not enough to explain why these pilgrims were not incorporated. Isa Blumi&rsquo;s work on the Ottoman refugees within the Balkans also lends credence to Chaterjee&rsquo;s criticisms. While standardization of language via textbooks and intellectual milieu in Romanian and Bulgaria seem to fit Anderson&rsquo;s critique, the social club Drita, founded in Romania managed to raise funds across the linguistic spectrum (Blumi, 74). Drita&rsquo;s prolific publications then managed to elicit challenges across multiple states within the Balkans across ethnolinguistic lines, which the theory of &ldquo;imagined communities&rdquo; cannot explain. If Romania, Bulgaria, and Albania saw themselves as individual communities, social clubs like Drita could have not existed, as each country standardized on different languages. Anderson&rsquo;s theory of imagined communities is appealing, but greater inspection through the history of central and peripheral states show that the theory does not hold up. Some of Anderson&rsquo;s theoretical constructs do apply, such as broad terms of print capitalism and the conception of a perceived homogenous time, but the Middle East has shown that nation-formations develop in more idiosyncratic lines.
Question 5 Outsiders play a vital role in the shaping of Middle East identities, and in turn, the nationalisms that arose. However, to fully discuss this role, the definition of an &ldquo;outsider&rdquo; within the context of the Middle East must be carefully defined. If an &ldquo;outsider&rdquo; is simply defined as a privileged class, typically based on ethnolinguistic lines, existing within a bounded state, then the concept of an &ldquo;outsider&rdquo; is simply inherited from the colonial and mandate eras. This is apparent within Simon&rsquo;s discussion of Iraqi nationalism, wherein he describes Iraqi nationalism strictly in terms of ethnic and linguistic groups in contrast to the Iraqi Sunnis. Simon&rsquo;s discussion focuses on the plight of the Iraqi Kurds, who longed for their own nation, Iraqi Shias, who comprised a plurality of the population but were deprived proportional representation within the state due to the British demand for a Sunni monarch, Iraqi Jews, whose communities were decimated due to factors outside their control, and the Assyrians, a British patroned group that suffered horrific reprisals as the British retreated. While it is appealing to carve up the insider/outsider paradigm based on the patronage lines of colonial powers, this framing is fundamentally limited in scope. Patronage lines were based on ethnolinguistic lines, and ethnolinguistic lines presuppose the existence of a permanent, unchanging sectarian identities, almost always tied to specific locations. To understand how outsiders affect nationalism and national identities within the Middle East, I believe it is necessary to expand the framing of who is an outsider. Outsiders are groups that are transtemporal as well as transpatial, outsiders can be born of a different time period as well as belonging to separate groups. The examples of the last Ottoman generation of officiers, who held a vital role in the shaping of mandate states, placed alongside Armenians, Kurds, and Iraqi show how outsiders shaped various states in idiosyncratic ways. The notion of a secular Iraqi state buttressed on sectarian lines arise from the early mandate era, and the existence of an unwritten sect-based state in Iraq today is a direct result of this. Turkish identity is based upon a strong cultural identity and a weak judicial one, leading to the paradox of &ldquo;privilege&rdquo; that Adar describes. Yassine al-Hashimi&rsquo;s role in the construction of Iraqi nationalism cannot be understated. The work of Michael Provonce shows us how al-Hashimi deftly understood the power structures being built by the British to rule Iraq. Although born in Baghdad, al-Hashimi was a member of the last generation of Ottoman sons, and studied at the elite general staff college during the Ottoman twilight years, where he (secretly) became a member of the CUP. During Mustafa Kemal&rsquo;s consolidation of power within Anatolia, al-Hashimi requested to return to Iraq after the coronation of Faiysal (Provence, 137), which, although he was originally born in the city, al-Hashimi was an outsider for having been absent over two decades. His later vocal criticisms of Faiysal based on disagreements about the level of cooperation with the British lead him to be a member of the &ldquo;opposition&rdquo;. Faiysal&rsquo;s pattern of temporarily appointing al-Hashimi prime minister in order to satisfy Iraqis shows how Iraqi nationalism is based on a rotating cast of power, that compromise is spurned for handouts to certain populations via a spoils system. Reconciliation between various groups in Iraq were not managed by developing true dialogue or &ldquo;big tent&rdquo; groups, but rather a management of frustration and anger among various groups. This bears remarkable similarity to the modern Iraqi political system, where prime ministerial candidates require the assent of US-aligned and Iran-aligned groups, and certain ministries are divided between them, while important ministries such as the oil ministry are left to the hands of technocrats. No true dialogue exists between these various groups, rather national identity itself is premised upon carving up the spoils of the state. Outsiders helped define the boundaries of the early Turkish republic as well, thereby creating the modern Turkish nationalist imaginary. The perceived privileged position of Armenians in the modern Turkish republic (Adar) is a sign of this, while Turkish citizenship is defined as anyone who had lived within Anatolia during the formation of the state, to be a Turk, culturally speaking, is drawn on far more strict lines. Adar talks about how an MP stated that &ldquo;authentic citizens belongs to the Hanefi sect of Sunni Islam and speaks Turkish&rdquo;. This line neatly cleaves out Armenians and Kurds from &ldquo;authentic citizenship&rdquo;, providing a root for a nationalist imaginary, distinct from the legal definitions. Yet the differences between the definition of a Turk in Turkish law and culture also serve to make Turkish identity somewhat malleable. If an Armenian publicly and routinely pledges loyalty to the state, they are considered &ldquo;privileged&rdquo; (Adar 743), as they have effectively leveraged their legal status as a Turkish citizen to join the cultural group of &ldquo;Turks&rdquo;. Furthermore, the Turkish cultural identity can be leveraged to change the legal status as well. The work of Faiz Ahmed in describing the close contact of ex-CUP officers in Afghanistan to the Turkish state displays this, ultimately with Afghanistan under Aman Allah becoming the first nation to recognize the newly created Turkish Republic, all stemming from broad pan-Islamic lines. The powers of these bonds held even after Kemal formally abolished the caliphate. The grey zone created by a distinction of law and culture with regards to Turkish identity provided ample space for the construction of a strong nationalist identity, as it clearly delineated the outsiders while providing enough room to absorb others under its aegis.
`}),e.add({id:1104,href:"/posts/nationalism_and_outsiders_in_the_middle_east_thesis/",title:"nationalism and outsiders in the middle east - thesis",content:`Introduction Works relating to constructivist approaches to nationalism has left much to be desired with regards to the contemporary role of religion. These works typically focus on religion as a component of nationalism in the construction of a state, managed by the state, or empowering sectarian identities. Using Hinnebusch&rsquo;s three tiered model of nationalism, consisting of supra-state, state-level, and sub-state actors, I propose that analysis of religion confined to a single stratum does not fully explain the power and integration of religion, especially in regards with supra-state nationalism. Religion permeates every single layer, and in turn exists in constant negotiation with nationalism.
This paper is defined into 3 portions. First, a review of the general literature is provided, providing an overview of individual interpretations of religion along historical and contemporary lines, and proposing to extend Hinnebush&rsquo;s model to include religion. The second section details this model and its applications to Iraq and Bosnia, two countries which saw extensive American involvement in the construction of their political systems. In particular, the construction of the constitution in Iraq and the implementation of the Dayton Peace agreement are examined, as constitutions and institutions are the results of actions by religiously-affiliated locals. With both of these countries, sub-state and state-level nationalisms and their relationship to religion are examined. Finally, jihad in both countries is presented as the condition in which state-level nationalisms are no longer functional, thereby showing that religion is somewhat of an analogous phoneoma to nationalism.
Current Literature Benard Anderson&rsquo;s seminal work on imagined communities fails to account for the contemporary status of religion. While Anderson provides for religion as a singular component of a nation or a ethnicity, the relationship between religion and nationalism is strictly one way. For Anderson, nationalism has not supplanted or superseded religion footcite:anderson_imagined_2006, but rather religion exists as a source for nationalism. Nationalism can harness religion as a place of gestation, or it can utilize religion to spread its beliefs. However, both of these roles hold religion as an unspeaking entity, either something unchanging from the past that can be pointed to as a crux, or something that can be molded. Religion, for Anderson, is a tool, much like ethnicity or language.
Other works attempt to tackle religion confined within a single stratum, typically only on the sub-state or supra-state level. Works such as footcite:saunders_ummah_2008 in the wake of the &lsquo;Cartoons Affair&rsquo; that generated significant backlash across a multitude of nations against depicitions of the Prophet Muhammad towards a Dutch newspaper typically analyze religion as a solely supra-state level issue. Religion here is interesting because it influences the digital field, and theories can be drawn about how such online communities can potentially constitute a &ldquo;nation&rdquo;. However, this again reduces religion to a single shared attribute. Westphalian ideas of nations, such as clearly delineated zones of sovereignty, equality of citizens, are applied to the digital realm via the linkage through religion. Here, religion is not far removed from ethnicity, an &ldquo;Islamic&rdquo; nation in the digital realm is not far removed from a &ldquo;Asian&rdquo; nation. Notions of &ldquo;pan-Islamism&rdquo; fall along these lines as well, placing religion jostling for position against nationalism. What this type of analysis lacks is an explanation for the role of religion on the sub-state level, the implicit assumption is that a supra-state &ldquo;nationalism&rdquo; encompasses state level and sub-state level nationalisms.
The work of Miroslav Hroch attempts to diagnose religion as part of a state, although on a purely mechanical level. In the wake of the fall of the Ottoman empire, a multitude of Balkan nations began a process to nationalize and control the levers of religion. Retooling religion as a myth and symbol of the state, Balkan nations seized control of the clergy and began to promulgate ideas that the church &ldquo;had served as a preserver of the nation through the dark centuries under the yoke&rdquo; footcite:anscombe_state_2014, 146. Here, the interpretation of religion is strictly state level, Orthodox christianity could be partitioned among the various states and its pieces seized upon as a symbol and a tool of legitimacy for the new governments. The outlier was Albania, which had completely banned religion in the 1960&rsquo;s. Drawing religion into the political sphere on the national level would later branch into religion as an opposition channel to nationalism as well as in conjunction with nationalism footcite:anscombe_state_2014, 221. In addition, religion and the state can be defined negatively, or by the lack of it. The sheer existence of a heterogeneous mix of religions within a single nation can also circumscribe the parameters of nationalism, forcing nations to create national myths around it, causing nations to engage in writing history that emphasises the cosmopolitan and diverse details.
As Talal Asad asks us to examine religion not as a set of beliefs, but rather through the actions of the religious, it becomes necessary to define what is considered religion. Borrowing Applebaum&rsquo;s definition of religion as a creed, a cult, and a code of conduct, and a confessional community, it is possible to define the actors of religion. Therefore, this article attempts to evaluate the understanding of religion through how the scattered sectarian groups of BiH and Iraq act.
In the same vein that religion is evaluated by those that perform it, nationalism can also be evaluated through its actors. Despite many problems within the Iraqi constitution, such as vague definitions of federal powers, very few actors deny the fundamental legitimacy of the Iraqi constitution (TODO: is this really true? can this be corroborated with some sources, it seems like its true via actions, but a paper would be nice.). As a result, although the many sectarian actors in Iraq disagree over which portions of the state they should receive, they fundamentally do not deny that the Iraqi state exists, and that the source of power for the Iraqi state is the Iraqi constitution.
BiH acts much of the same way. The Dayton Peace Agreement (DPA), although much maligned, created an astoundingly complex governmental structure that attempts to bring harmony over the three confessions via a concessional system. The DPA itself created the Office of the High Representative, an institution with an open mandate, little accountability to residents of BiH, and awesome authority over the executive, judiciary, and legislature of BiH. However, in spite of this undemocratic institution, only one group, the Serbians, deny its territorial integrity , and even this movement within the Serbs does not command a majority. In addition, the Serbian movement to separate from BiH is partially fueled by Serbian politicians. Ultimately, within the BiH, all agree that the DPA is flawed and reform is needed, all agree that reform has been forestalled, and most agree on the territorial integrity of the state as defined by the DPA.
The actions of state level nationalism, then, is the act of writing the 2005 Iraqi Constitution and the reforms implemented in the DPA. Examining the 2005 Iraqi Constitution as well as newer reforms of governance in the DPA should provide some insight into how the actors within these countries engage with nationalism and religion on a state level.
The Model Applied to Iraq Iraq&rsquo;s two nationalisms, the state level Iraqi nationalism and the sub-state level sectarian nationalism each negotiate their way with religion. Sub-state nationalism uses religion as the differentiator, although this becomes somewhat blurred when introducing Arab/Kurdish and Arab/Turkomen relations. However, this arises somewhat as a result of the unique status of the Kurdistan Regional Government within the Iraqi federation. On the national level, state-level nationalism attempts to arrest religion as part of the state. To look at these two layers, the sectarian nature of Iraqi substate nationalism must be examined in light of the 2005 constitution of Iraq.
The 2005 Iraqi constitution contains several notable features. The preamble itself is religious in nature, binding religion and Islam footcite:jawad_iraqi_nodate. Article 41 revives older, pre-1959, conceptions of personal status courts between Sunni and Shia, as well as allows experts in Islamic jurisprudence to hold positions within the judiciary. Article 140 is a clause that attempts to resolve disputed areas, especially the city of Kirkuk footcite:hanish_kirkuk_2010. Article 118 provides for space to enact laws regarding the form and status of autonomous regions. This was later filled with the Federalization Law, which provides not only the KRG with autonomy, but any three governorates within Iraq can form an autonomous region footcite:danilovich_iraqi_2016. Autonomous regions are empowered with a series of rights, the most notable of which allows autonomous regions to set up consulates in foreign countries.
At first glance, the 2005 Iraqi Constitution seems to be declared along distinctly sectarian lines, and is a mere document meant to delineate which portions of the state are appropriated to whom. Yet, the cancellation of the 1959 status law and its various amendments, which provides a foundation for civic nationalism, the status and nature of autonomous regions, and the overall religious tone of the document all reject the notion that the Iraqi constitution is simply a vessel for sectarian identities.
Article 2 of the Iraqi Constitution states that Islam is the religion of the federation, and that no law may contradict Islam, principals of democracy, or basic rights and freedoms . This &ldquo;explosive constituional cocktail&rdquo; rallies dicssusions about the compatibility of Islam and democracy. Yet, setting aside these theoretical arguments about the compatibility, the overall Islamic tone of the document was adopted by an agreement with the Kurds and the Shias, mediated by then-US Ambassador Khalilzad. Exchanging the adoption of personal status law and an Islamic document for federalism and guarantees that the personal status laws would not be applied to Kurdistan, an overall Islamic document was applied. However, this proves to be an interesting case for nationalism and religion. Two groups, who simultaneously agreed on the territories and boundaries of Iraq, also both agreed that it was possible to arrest religion and its actors to specific zones, in this case anywhere in Iraq except the KRG. This shows a fundamental agreement that the state itself is above the law, and a belief that state level nationalism is allowed to circumscribe where and how religion is applied (TODO: I&rsquo;m unsure of how convincing this argument is, perhaps find some other sources as well?)
Contrasted with this agreement on what Iraq is on a state level, individual sectarian groups within Iraq have very little agreement on how much religion should impact each individual sectarian identity. These range from the Kurdish notion, which does not place a particularly high emphasis on religion and focuses on the more &ldquo;practical&rdquo; aspects of sectarianism, such as recognition within parliament, to the Shi&rsquo;i, who themselves are fractured between those supporting Iran to those supporting Iraq. Even the Sunni sectarian identity is a relatively new occurrence, scholars such as Fandar Haddad have shown that the emergence of the Sunni identity was a relatively recent development following 2003. Furthermore, analysis of sectarian identities within Iraq cannot leave out the existence of the smaller minorities, such as the Turkomen, the Christian, and the Assyrian communities. In order to form a coherent analysis, analysis of sectarian identities will approach it from the perspectives of the Hashd al-Shaabi, or the Popular Mobilization Forces. Although the PMF was rooted in Ayatollah Sistani&rsquo;s &ldquo;mobilization&rdquo; fatwa of 2014, where he called for the defense of &ldquo;country, people, and holy places&rdquo; against the Islamic State, it has since grown to incorporate a heterogeneous mix of religions and identities. In this aspect, the PMF, which must be recognized as a distinct sub-state form of nationalism, as it does not cohere with the traditional policing and military mechanisms of the state, has renegotiated its complicated relationship to religion.
Estimated to contain about 45 brigades and over 130,000 members, the PMF today occupies a bizarre place within Iraq. While they function as independent military units following the gradual reduction of the threat of IS, the delegation of responsibility from the state, particularly the state budget, has simultaneously increased the number of people involved, while also splintering the dominant unity of the major religious groups. In essence, Sunni/Shia divisions have diminished as the Sunnis and Shi&rsquo;is have come closer to the halls of state power. Fanar Haddad footcite:haddad_diminishing_nodate notes that five lists shared 80 percent of the vote in 2005, while nine lists shared 80 percent of the vote in the 2018 elections. Furthermore, the division of Shi&rsquo;a between Iran aligned and Iraq aligned is a microcosm of the relationship between religion and sectarianism. The &ldquo;Construction Bloc&rdquo; in 2018 linked together the Fatah Alliance, a political party formed from PMF units broadly aligned with Iraq, alongside the Sunni National Axis footcite:haddad_diminishing_nodate. (TODO: possibly also talk about the split between the AAH and the Sadrist movement in 2004? They&rsquo;re both Shia parties).
In contrast to traditional beliefs that as actors acquire more political power, the centripetal mechanisms of the state force them to broaden their appeal, implying that actors become less religious as they move towards the center of the state, Iraq shows that sectarian actors can and will splinter, and continually realign themselves. While the core of the state is built on a shared civic identity, the unique situation of the Iraqi constitution, which binds Islam and democracy together, allows for sectarian actors to splinter and regroup along religious lines with time.
The Model Applied to BiH The Dayton Peace Agreement (DPA) attempts to legislate over a heterogeneous country dominated by homogenous autonomous regions. Like Iraq, where the country can roughly be split into three sectarian &ldquo;regions&rdquo;, BiH legislates this explicitly via the DPA. As the Croats, Bosniaks, and Serbs occupy over 90% of the ethnic makeup of the country, the history of ethnic cleansing has created a situation where nearly all Serbs, Croats, and Bosniaks live within a particular region. Split between the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBiH), mostly Bosniaks and Croats, and the Republika Srpska (RS), mostly Serbs, each zone has its own administrative particularities. However, unlike Iraq, where the sectarian parties directly influence the state, another actor exists within BiH: the Office of the High Representative (OHR). The OHR answers only to the Peace Implementation Council, a committee run by foreign ministries and largely influenced by the US footcite:li_universal_2020, can dismiss members of the executive branch up to and including presidents at will, and interprets its own, open-ended mandate footcite:knaus_travails_2003. As a result, the OHR presents an unique case for understanding of religion and nationalism on the state level, how do ordinary residents of BiH interpret the OHR?
Trust in the OHR has decreased precipitously with time. In 2010, 87% of citizens in BiH considered the state of affairs in BiH &ldquo;moving in the wrong direction&rdquo; footcite:kappler_everyday_2013. While some theorize that this is due to the cleavages in public space accounting for ethnic and sectarian problems, it remains that the government&rsquo;s interactions with religion has been relatively muted. The imposed federalist structure of the DPA distinctly does not recognize religion as a &ldquo;sect&rdquo;, choosing to prefer ethnic and national criteria . This is a similar &ldquo;explosive constitutional cocktail&rdquo; as the Iraqi constitution, as it leads into a merging of two identities: the state level one, defining the meaning of a citizen of BiH, and their sectarian one, what it means to be a Croat, Serb, or Bosniak.
Interestingly, this is the opposite of the Iraqi constitution. Whereas the Iraqi constitution explictly binds Islam and democracy and enshrines specific elements of the past, such as suffering under Saddam, the DPA is seen as illigetimate for scholars such as Esad Zgodić, who see the DPA as enshrining the current institutionalized divisions within BiH . As a result, state level nationalism within BiH remains in a grey zone with religion, by not expliciting binding religion to the state, it leaves religion unfettered as a tool for parties to play into.
On a sub-state level, religion has become the singular defining factor for the three groups . While Bosnia Serbs support the DPA due to the high level of autonomy provided, Croats feel disadvantaged by the system due to being the smallest minority, while Bosniaks are unhappy due to the calcification of the results of ethnic cleansing . These contesting identities have all leaned into religion as a marker of division, such as bishops calling for all Catholics to identify as &ldquo;Croat&rdquo; for a census footcite:malagic_bishops_2013. As Kiel notes, attempts at merging the meanings of &ldquo;Bosniak&rdquo; and &ldquo;Bosnian&rdquo; for Bosnian Muslims, where Bosnian Muslims self identify as &ldquo;Bosnian&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;Bosniak&rdquo; shows how sub-state nationalism have attempted to use religion as a tool to promote itself. In stating that Bosnian Muslims are &ldquo;Bosnian&rdquo;, the rejection of the &ldquo;Bosniak&rdquo; identity shows that they aspire for a greater role in religion within the national identity. Interestingly, this mirrors the &ldquo;Shi&rsquo;a-centric narrative of Iraqi nationalism&rdquo; . In attempting to merge their specific sectarian identity and the state level identity, both groups have argued for a stronger central state. For sub-state level nationalism, this shows that these individual groups all have different interpretations on how influential religion is within a singular, sectarian identity.
Jihad Jihad, ultimately, is an act left during the vacuum of a state. To understand this within Hinnebusch&rsquo;s model, jihad must be understood as both a supra-state level effect, such as the jihad in Bosnia, as well as simultaneously a sub-state effect, such as the existence of the Islamic State, a predominantly sSunni affair. As jihad is intimately tied with religion, examination of jihad along in terms of the actors allows the state to be defined negatively, that is, by what is lacking. If all elements of nationalism are categorized between supra-state, state, and sub-state levels, and jihad on the supra-state level takes certain elements, while jihad on the sub-state level acquires a different set of elements, then whichever elements left must be solely ascribed to state-level nationalism. From this, the jihad in Bosnia, which will be classified here as a supra-state affair, drew upon a series of universalisms and symbols that are remarkably similar to those used on the state-level, while the jihad on the sub-state level tends to fuel sectarian identities. This can be seen in the aftereffects of jihad, the former fighters of Bosnia jihad had a significantly different disarming process than those fighting against IS.
Following the onset of the Bosnian war in 1992, battalions called the Katiba were joined by foreign volunteers, seeking to fight alongside Bosnian Muslims. Although these battalions were formed from members hailing from over a dozen nations, they all fought underneath the flag of BiH. However, the disarmament process for these fighters were particularly interesting. On a ground level, they inhabited the same role as UN peacekeepers, and adopted much of the same universalisms. Darryl Li adopts this point, stating that during the war, a distinct identity of &ldquo;internationals&rdquo; formed, based around people who &ldquo;have no rigidly bounded body of membership&rdquo; . Li recognizes that this definition predominantly means the members of the &ldquo;International Community&rdquo;, yet he puts forward that this notion should extend to the foreign fighters as well. Both groups draw their legitimacy of violence form outside the state system, and both groups seek to supplement it via coalition building .
Both groups also left and disarmed in the wake of the DPA, even as there were significant disagreements among the foriegn fighters . Claiming that the &ldquo;peace is final&rdquo; , both the UN Peacekeepers and the Katiba handed over the reins of violence back to the state. In this act, if the basis of analysis is taking UN peacekeeping and the Katiba as supra-state nationalism, then the ability to justify violence is simultaneously an action of traditional, secular nationalism, such as the UN, and religious nationalism, such as the Katiba. Therefore, in the constant negotiation of religion and nationalism, it can be seen that religion can completely supplant nationalism on the state level. As opposed to constitutions that attempt to arrest religion such as Iraq, or peace agreements that largely ignore religion such as the DPA, jihad, when applied from a supra-state level, can encompass state level nationalism.
Jihad on the sub-state level faces its own set of challenges. Unlike jihad on the supra-state level, which claims a set of features that are bound into a greater community, sectarian jihad specifically focuses on exotling the differences. Al-Qaueda faced this in the Sahwa uprising, a tribal lead backlash against al-Qaueda in 2006. Tribal figures and Imams, supported by the US, mobilzed large groups of former insurgents and citizens against al-Qaeada within the al-Anbar province. Although the movement later fell apart for a myriad of reasons, economic reasons are largely ascribed as the main reason as the start of the uprising footcite:benraad_iraqs_nodate. Learning from this lesson, IS engaged in amenture ethnographic research in order to understand why Sunni tribes would choose to side with the US occupation footcite:whiteside_accidental_2020.
What can be gleaned from this process is the misunderstanding of the stratum of nationalism IS jihad resided in. Members of IS and al-Qaeda assumed their jihad was universal within the Sunni frame, which was distinctly not the case in the Sahwa uprising. Yet in many aspects, the Katiba was universal, or at least drew upon a set of supra-national frames for a cohesive identity. What explains these differences, even as both jihads occurred within overwhelmingly Sunni regions?
The difference lies in the source of legitimacy for violence. The Katiba fundamentally drew upon a set of ideas that were implicitly universal, Darryl Li describes how &ldquo;Bosnians and Arabs alike could indulge in nostalgia w out waving away the force of contemporary nationalist and sectarian categories&rdquo; . Yet there was no shared sense of supra-state nationalism within al-Qaeda and IS. In Iraq, jihad was rooted within a sectarian identity, which led to the Sahwa uprising.
Ultimately, what the differences in jihad between Iraq and Bosnia suggests that sectarian identities are inherently brittle constructs. While a singular religious sub-state nationalisms can be powerful within certain moments, they are likely to splinter and fracture given sufficient reasons. However, religious supra-state nationalisms are more adaptable and do not share the same attributes. Paradoxically, the stability of supra-state nationalisms within the context of jihad makes them easier to demobilize, as in the case of the Katiba largely disarming and leaving BiH, while both resistance against IS in the PMF and IS has taken on a sectarian tone. The applicability of the three tier model of supra-state to sub-state onto jihad itself shows that religion is analogous to nationalism.
Conclusion In reading religion through its actors, we can see that religious actors have both used religion towards nationalism and nationalism towards religion. The changing nature of sub-state nationalism embodied in sectarian identities, such as those in Iraq, shows that the understanding of these identities are not static throughout time. While Anderson&rsquo;s concept of an &ldquo;imagined community&rdquo; requires an understanding of a homogenous time , it can be seen that these sectarian identities do not abide by this understanding. These sub-state nationalisms fracture and refract, negotiating their position with religion across a spectrum. However, supra-state nationalisms, such as the Katiba, do rely on a concept of a homogenous time and belief. Applying Hinnebusch&rsquo;s three tiered model, I have shown that each strata within the model attempts to tackle religion in different ways within the context of Iraq and BiH, and that even in the absence of a state, this model is still applicable towards jihad. The current literature around nationalism and its relationship to religion is still relatively young within the field of nationalism studies, and additional research could be done with regards to the changing situation in Iraq, jihad and nationalism within Chechnya, and even more religiously aligned but secular states. The understanding of nationalism premised upon a secular civic state is antiquated, and pushing past that frame to incorporate religion as an active component allows for greater understanding of what nationalism is.

Proposal Draft Introduction We have discussed the roles that outsiders play within the construction of the Middle East, such as the role of Armenians with in the formation of nationalism for modern day Turkey, sectarian identities for nationalisms within Iraq, even the construction of national identities during the Mandate era through colonial tools. However, all of these discussions share a single feature: we take for granted that the national identity being constructed and the outsider acting in concert with it exist within the same historical time frame. From this, I am interested in tackling the ideal of transtemporal nationalisms: can nationalism and national identity be constructed against an outsider that no longer exists, and if so, how?
The answer appears to be a resounding yes at first blush, with the most clear example being the Turkish Republic. If the transtemporal framing is accepted, then Turkish state is built top of the &ldquo;outsider&rdquo; of the Ottoman Empire, with republican values hoisted above the the &lsquo;ruins&rsquo; of the Ottoman empire. In fact, this concept of &lsquo;Ottoman ruins&rsquo; and nations &rsquo;emerging&rsquo; from these ruins is an often-repeated one. What I am curious specifically about is the idiosyncractic ways these develop, espically in the cases of the Balkans and Iraq. Since the scope of this question easily encompasses vast swaths of the Middle East, I am interested in tackling this question similar to Hinnebusch, where a central theory was provided and a small case study follows. I will attempt to take a look at two nations: Iraq and Bosnia, although the fluid borders of the Balkans makes the &ldquo;Bosinan&rdquo; designation somewhat difficult to pin down.
This question is interesting to me since the focus of my master&rsquo;s thesis is on how class, sect, and religion interact within the nexus of conflict. The Dodge and Hinnebusch readings were already helpful in illuminating some of these identities, but I am also curious if the models presented within them can be pushed further to other states &rsquo;emerging from Ottoman ruins&rsquo;.
Literature Review A wide range of literature already exists on these topics. Specifically, I am interested four works to start with: Memory of State by Eric Davis, The Universal Enemy by Darryl Li, State, Faith, and Nation in Ottoman and Post-Ottoman Lands by Frederick Anscombe, and Gatekeepers of the Arab Past by Yoav DiCapua.
Memories of State is strictly concerned within the Iraqi context, describing the retooling and reworking of the past existed under the Ba&rsquo;thist regime. It makes the argument that Iraqi national identity is leaned towards pluralism due to both historical and demographic reasons, and the Ba&rsquo;thist regime attempted to suppress and rework this pluralism for its own purposes. It is possible that State of Repression by Lisa Blaydes should be added here as well, although I will reevaluate this after I finish Blaydes&rsquo;s book.
The Universal Enemy by Li is a strict monograph of the Bosnian jihad. While the book itself is more concerned with anthropological studies of the foreign fighter as a transnational solidarity, I am curious to see if this can constitute a nationalism within itself. Previously in class we have distinguished supra-nation movements such as pan-Arabism and the Ummah as a political entity, but does foreign fighter movements fit underneath this umbrella as well? The placement of Bosnia makes this all the more interesting towards the topic.
State, Faith, and Nation is a large comparative study of post-Ottoman nations from a classical &ldquo;Christian vs Muslim&rdquo; framing. Anscombe draws nationalism and state formation into two large buckets: those in the Balkans (therefore &ldquo;Christian&rdquo;) and those in Middle East (therefore &ldquo;Muslim&rdquo;), and Turkey as an outlier. His argument is nuanced, but he does never make the leap into a direct comparison between the Balkans and the Middle East I am interested in.
Gatekeepers of the Arab Past might be cut, but DiCapua&rsquo;s model of the formational of the concept of &ldquo;Egypt&rdquo; is an interesting one and I am keen to see if it can be reapplied.
Connection to Class Themes and Concepts The question of transtemporal outsiders connects to the idea of constructivism, as it leans heavily into the idea that because nationalisms are constructed, they can reference identities across different periods in time. Also tying into the idea of distinctive ethnies by Smith, I believe the comparison between the two seemingly unreleated countries of Iraq and Bosnia is an interesting one. Both countries have had large &ldquo;jihadist&rdquo; movements (using that term liberally) occur, both are somewhat dogged by an artificial state narrative, both exist currently under a political system centered around careful slicing of the state among different groups, heavily influenced by the US.

intro Motivating question: can neural network methods do anything that resembles compositional semantics?
What&rsquo;s our metric? How do we know we&rsquo;ve accomplished a goal? also sometimes called recongizing textual entailment (rte) - same as nli
example: premise -&gt; hypothesis, does the premise entail the hypothesis?
Ido Dagan 05
We say that T entails H, if typically, a human reading T would infer that H is most likely true
NLI entailment is a lot more loose than semantic entailment
same looseness applies to contradiction what is the meaning of a sentence?
this is unproductive, we can&rsquo;t really know what &ldquo;&ldquo;&ldquo;meaning&rdquo;&rdquo;&rdquo; is alternative question: what concrete phenomena do you have to deal with to understand a sentence? focus on behaviors instead
for NLI to work, you need to understand a lot:
NLI is an ungrounded tasks - we do not require systems to look at situations outside of langauge
if you know the truth condition of two sentences, can you work out if one entails the other?
NLI asks us to reasonable about things even if we don&rsquo;t know what it means
datasets datasets: FraCas Test Suite, Recongizing Textual Entailment (RTE), Sentences Involving Compositional Knowledge (SICK-E), Stanford NLI Corpus (SNLI), Multi-Genre NLI (MNLI), Crosslingual NLI (XNLI), SciTail what about multiple events? two sentences about a boat in different places, we assume same boat, say contradictoin two sentences unrelated, label neutral but then the boat question must be talking about neutral but then contradiction only occurs when sentences are extremely general and broad thus we must impose a rule that sentences are almost always taken to mean the same event this means that contradiction == &ldquo;any situation where two sentences can&rsquo;t be describing the same event&rdquo; often times this can be referred to with photos (i.e. can two sentences be describing the same photo?)
Stanford NLI Corpus (SNLI) uses this Multi-Genre NLI (MNLI) goes for this, but goes beyond visual scenes annotation artifacts somewhat possible to infer the premise from the hypothesis by the way it&rsquo;s worded
models can do moderately well on NLI without looking at the premise
- aka you can do well on these dataset measurements without _doing the nli task_ - has prompted a dataset design changes, such as [Adversarial NLI (ANLI)](/posts/adversarial_nli/) learning Feature based models logistic regression, bag of words features on hypthesis, bag of word-pairs features to capture alignment, tree kernels natural logic rules based non ML work on NLI is here formal logic for deriving entailments between a pair of sentences operates directly on words generally sound, entailment here means actual entailment but not complete, cannot detect some entailments requires clear structural parallels most NLI datasets won&rsquo;t work with this theorem proving attempts to translate sentences into logical forms open-domain semantic parsing is still hard more difficult than natural logic deep learning 2015-17 - attempted to built DL systems that understood natural logic machinery has gotten very complex, and BERT style models have replaced it transformers have replaced it applications 3 major types direct application
original motivation Fact Extraction and Verification (2018) multi-hop reading comprehension like OpenBook and MultiRC use it integrating Stanford NLI Corpus (SNLI)/Multi-Genre NLI (MNLI) trained ESIM model into a larger model in two places helps to select and combine relevant evidence for a question long form text generation can use NLI to prevent hte model from saying things that contradicts itself not as useful as a direct application nli as a research and evaluation tasks
very used for benchmarking glue caveat state of the art benchmark is very close to human performance in other words, state of the art datasets are not high quality enough, so the datasets are &ldquo;solved&rdquo; nli as a pretraining task in transfer learning
if you teach a model NLI, it should be reasonably good at other tasks take a model, fine tune it on MNLI, and then fine tune it again this works well even in conjunction with strong baselines for pretraining like RoBERTa beyond nli winograd schemas cyc atomic `}),e.add({id:1108,href:"/posts/natural_logic/",title:"natural logic",content:`Tags: nlp

Capitalization affects how models perform (we&rsquo;ve seen this at work)
Normalization definitely affects how models perform, but most arabic models already normalize (camel, Zampieri et al: SemEval-2020 Task 12: Multilingual Offensive Language Identiﬁcation in Social Media (OffensEval 2020)), etc.
What are we losing with normalizing? What are we losing with case folding?
https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/capitalizationcase-folding-1.html NER and entity linking Preprocessing is normalizing and reducing casing without much thought increases the consistency of the output by reducing the search space, but has the problem of losing potential context example: spongbob text encodes sentiment this becomes more problematic with arabic, since diacritziation actually has meaning arabizi et al Draft Currently, most natural langauge processing models have a pre-processing stage, where the text itself is cleaned up, before feeding into the model. This has quite a few benefits, mostly to reduce the amount of information the model has to learn, and gives more consistent results. For example, you wouldn&rsquo;t want your model to distinguish iphone and IPHONE as two different things (normally). The same thing happens in a similar process for Arabic (when written with unicode). A Unicode normalization step usually happens, especially for tools like CAMeL, which is necessary since letters in Arabic can have many different forms (&ldquo;لا&rdquo;, for example, is comprised of two different letters, ل and ا). On top of this, another form of orthographic normalization is performed, which converts visually similar letters into a single form1.
One thing that I&rsquo;m concerned with is the fact that Arabic tools seem to take it to another level and remove diacritics from words as well. To me, this seems like a problem, since diacritics are not a function of the written form of Arabic, but actually have bearing on the specific meanings. Here, there&rsquo;s three layers:
The meaning of the word in Arabic &lt;&ndash; diacritics are here The written form of the word in Arabic &lt;&ndash; orthographic normalization is here The written form of the word in Unicode &lt;&ndash; Unicode normalization is here For natural language processing models to work, the models need data that is as close to the meanings of the words (which may not map nicely to the word itself), without removing too much meaning from each word. Unicode normalization and orthographic normalization are necessary because they unravel the quirks of the Arabic script, which is largely independent of what the word means (a misspelled word still means the same thing with enough context).
To put it in English terms, take the Spongebob Text Meme. Capitalization here actually does modify the meaning of the text, it makes the text sarcastic! However, if you feed a model all lowercased text, it&rsquo;ll never learn to distinguish when capitalization does have a bearing on meaning. For purposes such as sentiment analysis, this is a major problem.
From how I see it, capitalization in English and diacritics in Arabic take on similar roles, where they can sometimes embue meaning on top of the words themselves. And while it&rsquo;s kind of lame to end a post talking about how people need to be more careful about their data and their goals, we shouldn&rsquo;t blindly take text preprocessing as a &ldquo;solved&rdquo; problem.

Half the people don&rsquo;t know stats, so what&rsquo;s the next step? are we all going to become statisticans? are we just fostering a bunch of bad notebook navigators? biostatistics and its methodologies complex systems that has developed idioscrycratic ideas just as critical race theory has developed, we need digital humanities systems to be as devleoped adding infographics and charts is just mathwashing in the same way economists did this is just butterfly collecting Draft As I&rsquo;ve been slowly preparing for PhD applications in Applied Math, I thought it would be interesting to write up my experiences in doing a humanities MFA, since I have a CS/Astronomy background.
Having briefly dipped my toes into the pool of &ldquo;digital humanities&rdquo;, I&rsquo;m ready to tap out. From my glance at it, digital humanities programs attempt to bridge a false binary, in an attempt to create a pool of students who are neither statisticians nor software engineers.
Like any good NLP practitioner, I&rsquo;m going to punt on the exact meaning of &ldquo;digital humanities&rdquo;, since the term has become loaded and there already exists better articulated answers. For the purpose of this post, I&rsquo;m going to take &ldquo;digital humanities&rdquo; to mean any any humanities-first program (a program where the core classes are in humanities) that attempts to incorporate aspects of computing, whether that be data visualization, data gathering, sentiment analysis, anthropology, bias studies, etc.
The core problem with digital humanities, from how I see it, is that it sets up the binary of two groups1: a group with the tools to conduct research (computing), and another group that builds on the theories (humanities). As more of human interaction moves online, the assumption is that digital tools can help those in the humanities reach more falsifiable results.
The clear issue in this assumption is that digital tools are not a turnkey toolbox that can be handed over to every student. Given that most of digital humanities comes down to some form of mucking around with data, most of digital humanities becomes a statistics problem!
The social sciences have done an awful job with the digital tools they&rsquo;ve been provided. The replication crisis, &ldquo;widely regarded as rooted in methodological or statistical shortcomings&rdquo;2 has shown us that fields such as criminology is pretty much worthless3 and that prestigious journals have terrible replication rates4. Social sciences have shown themselves to be extremely;y vulnerable to p-hacking, to an almost comical degree of statistical incompetence. What are the chances of teaching statistics to humanities students who are simultaneously burned ed with learning the tools of software engineering at the same time?
Even setting aside the impossibility of teaching a coherent &ldquo;digital humanities&rdquo; curriculum, the question then becomes, what is digital humanities good for? If we assume that the goal is to make the theories of humanities falsifiable5, the scope of most theories is so large to make this effort intractable. Papers in the digital humanities field run the risk of becoming similar to linguistics when it adopted a heavy mathematical focus: a large complex system beset by the alignment problem. Modern linguistics per Chomsky is split into two camps: statistical and theory6. It was widely thought that statistical models were useful for engineering, but could not lead to more insight, and so the entire complex field of theory-heavy linguistics bloomed. However, as it turned out, compute beats clever every time, and the theory-heavy side has morphed into a category theory lookalike that fails to have any real world applications, while statistical models such as neural networks have generated many insights into the structure of languages in a single decade. If digital humanities only uses digital tools to validate theories, the entire endeavor becomes butterfly collecting.
The best hope of digital humanities is to adopt a path similar to biostatistics. Biology is a massively complicated field with combinatoric complexity, and biostatisticans have developed unique statistical power tests, designed for their field, to validate their results. However, these are sophisticated and nowhere close to the turnkey nature digital humanities programs want. Digital humanities has a future, but it will be with statisticans and engineers adopting the humanities, not the other way around.
The binary of &ldquo;two cultures&rdquo; was long identified in mathematics far before the humanities adopted it: https://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~wtg10/2cultures.pdf&#160;&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;

As friends and coworkers have moved away, either temporarily or permanently, I&rsquo;ve been thinking about what makes this city special for me, having lived in a bunch of other cities across the world. So this is my entry into the &ldquo;What makes NYC special&rdquo; Discourse, only eight months after everyone else has posted their own quarantine-induced &ldquo;What makes NYC special&rdquo; posts.
I think what many people get wrong about this city is what it offers. Whether that&rsquo;s the museums, Central Park, the food, and so on, I think people tend to think of these things as what makes New York. And so when they look at all of NYC&rsquo;s problems, such as egregious rent, terrible traffic, mediocre public transit, corrupt politics, and run the cost-benefit analysis, they arrive at the &ldquo;why would anyone want to live here&rdquo; conclusion.
In my view, looking at the products NY produces vs the cost is a level-zero Bad Take. This is not to say NY is a better city than others, since that&rsquo;s most a subjective call. Rather, this is to say that if you analyze NYC as a consumer, you&rsquo;re missing out on a lot of what the city has to offer. Proust has this line about how the true voyage is to see the same place with a hundred different eyes, rather than seeing a hundred places with the same eyes. Uniquely pretencious in the &ldquo;motivational poster&rdquo; type of way, it still rings true for NY, more so than any other city I&rsquo;ve lived in.
In thinking about the friends I&rsquo;ve made since I first moved here in 2016: tech workers, fruit vendors, deli guys, journalists, creative types, refugees, activists, etc, etc, the one thing is that NY makes it easy to find voices that resonate with yours. NY offers not just tribes for you to join and fit in, but also offers you the rare coin of possibility, the chance to join different tribes with little effort. The voices you find in NY aren&rsquo;t the same as your voice, but rather they complement it. These voices are met with shared serendipity, you meet them at a party, at a back of a bar, on the streets smoking shisha, anything. These voices are not the same as yours, nor will they ever be the same, but they harmonize. The shared struggles of NY gives a platform to resonate, the guy running the fruit stand during my commute is a fellow brother. It&rsquo;s the ultimate fellow strangers story, except it happens with a hundred people every hour of the day, and, here&rsquo;s the key, you can pierce the veil of strangeness. The walls people put up in this city are largely performative, I rarely encounter someone who doesn&rsquo;t want to make a new friend.
New York&rsquo;s myths take hold as well. Poll a hundred people about NY, most of them will have some opinions, even if they&rsquo;ve never lived here. Poll a hundred people about other American cities, I guarantee you the opinions will not be as intense or as varied. The noterity of NY itself gives life to a particular drama about living here, a drama that contains an entire history of voices from a thousand different cultures. I would argue that NY&rsquo;s cultural experiences are actually not that interesting, anyone can find facsination with the experiences of their own city. NY&rsquo;s history is not objectively more interesting than the history of Urbana-Champaign. NY&rsquo;s arts and music experiences are not objectively better than the ones of Chicago. Any place&rsquo;s history can be plumbed for infinite facsination.
But what NY offers you is the chance to partipate, not just consume. People in this city constantly orginate what they cannot finish, and the density of people combined with the accessbility of neighborhoods puts you in close contact. People in this city who resonate with you enhance the experience, similar to how it is one thing to listen to music alone, and a whole other to listen to music in a car with a friend. NY presents you with options in the present, but also offers you the possbilty creating your own options in the future.
Oh and the food certainly helps.

Benefit of college is not the content, but the free space to let your ideas ruminate Slowness without burnout polymath without dilettante
Draft this post is far more rambling than my regular ones
It&rsquo;s been a year. Normally I&rsquo;d write up something wrapping up about my goals and how far I accomplished, but I think for me this year was one long lesson in understanding the difference between being a dilettante and a polymath.
I&rsquo;ve always been terrified of being a dilettante, mostly because it creates some sort of &ldquo;crank&rdquo; identity, such as the weirdos who post about timecubes or start &ldquo;writing&rdquo; (if we can use that term) stuff and putting it on vixra. Being a dilettante always seemed being like those DC bro types who start writing essays about &ldquo;death the of Hong Kong&rdquo;, having never been there. Dilettantism slides easily into delusions, especially as the world concentrates more and more power into smaller and smaller segments of people. How can anyone trust their own decisions when the knowledge you have is so subjectively little? Pikety writes about how economists should stop adopting mathematical language when economists know very little of anything, the language and rigor are separate things. The same thing happens in nearly all the social sciences at this point, the poor undergrad kid aggressively trying to p-hack his way to a paper is subject to the greater forces of adopting language without rigor.
What the hell is a polymath then? To be honest, I used to think it was someone that picked specific fields and went deep into them. For me, the stuff I wanted to master was distributed systems, militias in Iraq, and linguistic shit. Which, all things considered, is going pretty well. I switched teams at work to the NLP team, which rekindled my desire for software engineering while opening doors to working on more linguistics-related things, but also am going deep into Kubernetes currently. So that&rsquo;s been working out pretty well.
Back to polymath-ism. There&rsquo;s actually a novel called &ldquo;The Polymath&rdquo; that&rsquo;s about Ibn Khaldun, which I&rsquo;ve been meaning to read about this. Ibn Khaldun was brilliant, and I can really only hope to reach a portion of the amount of insight he produced. Yet one thing I&rsquo;m beginning to notice is that knowledge production and bridging is what has differentiated my current work from the past. I&rsquo;m actively writing more and attempting to bridge my knowledge of software, middle east studies, and linguistics, on higher levels than I had thought before. I&rsquo;m rereading Godel, Escher, Bach again, while reading Steps to an Ecology of Mind for the first time. At the same time, I&rsquo;m going through a book club on Braben&rsquo;s Scientific Freedom.
So it&rsquo;s been a year. I bought a place, I trained a lot more, I studied a lot more, and at the end of it, the only lesson I have is that I need to rethink how I approach ideas. I used to think ideas were static sets of things to acquire or discard, each idea was a historical nugget to either stash away, use quickly, or chuck out. But at the end of this year, I&rsquo;ve realized that I need to let the ideas ruminate and grow in the background, the ecology of the mind, as it were. Who knows what next year is going to be like, but I weirdly have a feeling it&rsquo;s going to be a good year.

Review of Parliamentarism: From Burke to Weber, by William Selinger, and Parliament the Mirror of the Nation: Representation, Deliberation, and Democracy in Victorian Britain, by Gregory Conti
https://www.instapaper.com/read/1297320439 Claims that we&rsquo;ve missed the power of the parlimentarism machine. Power radiated from the purse, and the House of Commons controlled all bills.
France refined parlimentarism in the wake of the French Revolution and theorized the concepts in the 18th century.
Leading to:
Britan as classical parliamentary theory: consitutional monarchs who reigned but did not govern. Queen acted as an upper ceiling Parliament as a mirror of the nation means a multifacted understanding of what is being mirrored. Things are like a terrain of battle, and the meaning of mirroring/right way of mirroring was peaking in the 19th century.
Conti&rsquo;s Victorian thinkers believed that Parliament being a mirror means reflecting all the salient divisions of the nation.
For many years now, scholars of political thought have focused on the origins of liberalism, the perceived tension between “liberalism” and “republicanism,” and the notions of freedom that underpin each. This has led to a special interest in the 18th century as a time of political founding, and a particular concern with the classical authors on which Enlightenment political thinkers frequently drew.
https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/the-danger-of-deconsolidation-the-democratic-disconnect/ Understanding of represenative democracies has more than currently being offered, ideas in the 18th and 19th century has more to discover.
Implict is the understanding that there is not an equal judicial &ldquo;constitutional court&rdquo; because the free legaslative assembly would be making the power.

Summary Talks about how human annotations and disagreements from those are not derived from statistical noise More context does not necessarily mean more agreement, once the input reaches sentence/passage, disagreements hold relatively steady We assume what people write is what they mean, but actually there&rsquo;s a pretty big gap between what people mean &lt;-&gt; what they write &lt;-&gt; what they interpret &lt;-&gt; what they infer. NLP models currently only model the 2nd and 3rd arrows. punted on precise definitions of &ldquo;real world&rdquo; and rather tried to have their models approximate &ldquo;what humans do&rdquo; Annotations Uses a combination of RTE2, SNLI, MNLI, JOCI, and DNC RTE2 - premises/hypothesis combos SNLI - premises from image captions, hypoteshis from existing NLI dataets paired with hypotehsis that were automatically generated MNLI - Same as SNLI but with a range of text genres JOCI - &ldquo;commen sense&rdquo; inferences DNC - mostly naturally occuring premises paired with template generated hypothesis Preprocessing They had 500 workers complete and rank the response on a slider Continous scale not always the best, they had to do some z-score normalization in order for all the data to make sense Analysis Ultimately wanted to judge how much &ldquo;noise&rdquo; exists in the annotation process
If there is a single truth, then the the &ldquo;noise&rdquo; should be generalizable with a single gaussian distribution
If there are &ldquo;multiple&rdquo; truths, then a gaussian mixture model should be correct
Assumption: if a single truth exists, the GMM woul be the exact same as the gaussian
Model chooses to fit towards the GMM than the gaussian
Example: is the word &ldquo;swat&rdquo; forceful? Is &ldquo;confess that&rdquo; factive?
In the first section, they note that the annotations can be modeled by the GMM, implying that humans believe there are multiple &ldquo;truths&rdquo;
NLP models currently only believe there is one truth to model Context Sampled sentences from wikipedia, and considered each sentence to be a premise, and generated a hyptothesis by replacing the corresponding a word from the premise with a substiute word, where the substitue word is either a hypernym/hyponym, antonym, or co-hyponym Collected ratings at 3 levels word sentence passage Disagreements among raters actually increase when more context is shown Definitely some confounds abound Model Predictions Is this a problem at all? what if the underlying distributions already reflect the distributions observed in human judgements, and the models already adaquetely capture that with softmax? since nli is usually treated as a classification, they discretize (after experimenting with z-normalied human scores) by mapping into different bins entailment~/~contradiction~/~neutral label bins They used a pretrained bert and fine tuned it on the labels Attempted to see how well bert captured the underlying multi-modal distribution with a softmax found that the softmax is a poor approximation

This post is intended to help out any other students who are trying to get a grasp on the field of disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration (DDR) and security sector reform (SSR). I&rsquo;ve found it quite difficult to get a good orientation on the field, especially coming into it barefaced.
Starting Out https://www.unddr.org/ - UN DDR guidelines Basically the center of this, the UN truly lies at the center of DDR and SSR efforts. It&rsquo;s important to note that the field has largely begun to shift away from DDR and SSR as a whole and more towards preventing violence and outbreak of conflict. https://peacekeeping.un.org/en/disarmament-demobilization-and-reintegration - UN Peacekeeping Guidelines Chances are, if you&rsquo;re reading this post, you&rsquo;ve already read this before. But if not, this provides some good up-to-date information about where and how DDR and SSR are being carried out. https://peacekeeping.un.org/sites/default/files/the_changing_landscape_of_armed_groups.pdf - &ldquo;Next Generation&rdquo; DDR This report is a good introduction to what is called &ldquo;next generation&rdquo; DDR. DDR has gone through three iterations: the first in the 90&rsquo;s in response to peace accords and formal military structures in Africa, the second a &ldquo;integrated&rdquo; DDR iteration that incorporates the well-being of minority groups and focuses on a more flexible approach, and a &ldquo;next generation&rdquo; DDR iteration that incorporates armed non-state actors. http://gsdrc.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/HDQ1368.pdf - DDR Generations This short report gives a broad-based overview into the various DDR iterations. https://peacekeeping.un.org/sites/default/files/un_ddr_in_an_era_of_violent_extremism.pdf - Community Violence Reduction and DDR This addresses some of the shifts in the field lately. http://www.iddrtg.org/resources/ - Integrated DDR Working Group Resources I&rsquo;m a little bearish on the usefulness of this website, but this group collaborates with the design and implementation of DDR groups. Papers and Books https://reliefweb.int/report/angola/multi-country-demobilization-and-reintegration-program-end-program-evaluation-final, https://reliefweb.int/organization/tdrp The Multi-Country-Demobilization Program (MDRP) and the Transitional Demobilization and Reintegration Program (TDRP) are two of the largest multi-country DDR programs in the past two decades. Muggah, Robert, and Chris O’Donnell. “Next Generation Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration.” Stability: International Journal of Security &amp; Development 4, no. 1 (May 21, 2015). https://doi.org/10.5334/sta.fs. Establishes what we could conceivably call &ldquo;next generation&rdquo; DDR. Williams, Paul R., and Milena Sterio, eds. Research Handbook on Post-Conflict State Building. Research Handbooks in International Law Series. Northampton: Edward Elgar Publishing, 2020. This book is actually quite broad and zooms further out than just DDR and SSR. While it&rsquo;s largely not that good at giving practitioner level advice, but does give a useful organizational framing for post-conflict state-building. I found this quite useful for framing my understanding of DDR. Schulhofer-Wohl, Jonah, and Nicholas Sambanis. “Disarmament, Demobilization, and Reintegration Programs,” n.d., 82. This is a nice and short literature review from 2010 about DDR. Journals To be perfectly honest, I haven&rsquo;t used these journals that much, except to quickly glance at what&rsquo;s happening. So take these recommendations with a grain of salt.
The current journals I&rsquo;m looking at are:

Your book claims that one reason we do not see such revolutionary change is because there’s a lack of freedom.

&ldquo;The essential thing is to build up mutural trust. If the scientists don&rsquo;t trust you, they won&rsquo;t tell you what they really want to do. They&rsquo;re accustomed to being cut off&rdquo;
&ldquo;We are looking for anyone that can say current thinking is wrong&rdquo;
&ldquo;Even if someone comes along and says &lsquo;I can solve this problem&rsquo;, it will still be incomplete. But we need to take another step, and only individuals can take another step.&rdquo;
In this podcast, we spoke with Professor Don Braben, who is the author of Scientific Freedom: The Elixir of Civilization and several other books. Professor Braben ran the Research Venture Unit from 1980 to 1990 in BP, providing over £20 million to over 30 researchers and teams from Europe and north America. He spoke about the necessity of finding and funding scientists, in order to free scientists from the auspices of the funding agencies.

Notes Taqwim al-Nil (DiCapua - Gatekeepers of the Arab Past) is a sign of this type of modernizing thinking Argument: The construction of the Aswan Low/High Dams, alongside the Hindiya and Kut barrages, was a time of technomodernity that ultimately failed to respect the locals. Construction of the Aswan Low Dam would &ldquo;modernize&rdquo; the locals Construction of the Hindiya barrage would Kut Barrage Constructed in 1934, opened in 1939

High Aswan Dam Meeting with Jim on irrigation research Dumb question: why does the historiography matter?
Reading essay on why the orientalist perceptions, but having a difficult time squaring why that it matters I have all these resources
How do we square notions of modernity (as in what we consider to be modern either by orientialist perspectives or not)
Two main points:
obsession with history (philae, babylon, etc) lack of care about disease and salination (because it mostly affects the people and not infectious) Disease and salination are both extremely common throughout all these projects, why was it not brought up?
Beacuse these affect the people and not the workers nor their ideals Why should I care? What is modernity?

Abstract The opening of the Aswan Low Dam in 1902, as well as the Aswan High Dam in 1960 in Egypt has drawn significant scholarship in modernization theory and environmental history. Notions of modernity within Egyptian society were debated about within the context of both the Low and High dams. Yet curiously little is written about the dams of Iraq, specifically the Hindiya Barrage, opened in 1913, and the Kut Barrage, opened in 1939. These two Iraqi dams provide unique lenses against the scholarship of the Aswan dams within the notions of modernity and development, as the Low Dam and the Hindiya Barrage were constructed under the Ottoman Empire, while the High Dam and the Kut Barrage were constructed after both nations had technically achieved indpendence from the British state. This article examines the technical background, environmental impact, and the modernization trends that took hold in both Egypt and Iraq during these periods.

Week 1 Hegel et al., Phenomenology of Spirit. Dialects between the master and slave Master requires the slave to recongize him as the master, whereas the slave later derives self worth from their labor, which then leads to a more developed conciousness of self for the slave The master/slave distinction is caused because two recongize that each other is required to distinguish the self, and from that, the one who chooses to value life over death becomes weaker, and therefore the slave Fanon notes that this dialectic is not complete for the colonial, the colonized often end up mimicking the colonizers, which does not lead to a more developed conciousness of the self not to mention the colonizer becomes brutalized in the process, which suggests that there is more development that the simple dialectic gives Kant, “AN ANSWER TO THE QUESTION: WHAT IS ENLIGHTENMENT?” Transtemporal meaning of man, argues man&rsquo;s natural state is towards &ldquo;enlightement&rdquo; as civilization Paradoxically, this requires a structure to exist to preserve it (enlightened despot) Distinguishes between private and public freedoms Private freedom is when you hold certain privilages, such as pastor or soldier, where your choices are constrained. In cases of rulers, their choices are even more constrained, but constrained in choosing not to do something importance of &ldquo;presentism&rdquo;, Kant believes that we are on the verge of something radical, and that there is potential in the presentism Du Bois and Edwards, The Souls of Black Folk. A mixture of both Kant and Hegel, Du Bois suggests that post-emancipation black lives are at the precipice of something new (he calls this Canaan, similar to Kant&rsquo;s presentism), but also suggests that the act of self reconigition between blacks and whites about their differences causes a dual conciousness to appear within the black community Week 2 Williams - Marxism and Literature discusses the base and superstructure formulation, and says that superstructure is the &ldquo;ideaology of the class&rdquo;, and the &ldquo;form of conciousness&rdquo; (pg 76) so superstructures arise from legal and political wrt to production (institutions) forms of conciousness which is a specific view of the world (forms of conciousness) and a process where men become concious of the economic conlfict (political and cultural) aruges that these concepts almost magically appear into being (pg 77 bottom), and possibly their definitions do not capture everything marx&rsquo;s attempt here was to link thought and activity, which before him, had been separated, but marx hasn&rsquo;t built anything radically new, rather he largely redefined thought into superstructure and activity into base, and then proceeded to link them together marx&rsquo;s unconvincing argument that art does not correlate to the peak of any culture argues that what people are fundalmentally lacking is the recgonition that connections between material production and institutions and conciousness proposes Plekhanov&rsquo;s distinction of five sequential elements instead (state of productive forces, economic conditinos, socio-political regimes, psyche of social man, and other ideaologies) basically says that when the analysis begins from superstructure and base, they fail to recongize that these two entities are arrived at, not started from superstructures tend to reach out to big things and encompass a variety of ideas that tends to make the differences between the two entities believable reudction of base to a category is something marx warned against reflection and mediation talk about the processess in between the base and super structure is this anything more than a finite state machine with hidden markov states? Draft about Williams Williams spends significant time discussing the Marxist understanding of base and superstructure as a leaky abstraction. He first describes the concept of a base (or by his art as reflection analogy, as &ldquo;reality&rdquo;) which represents the Marxist concept of the physical production processes, and superstructure (&ldquo;art&rdquo; or &ldquo;reflection of reality&rdquo;) as everything else non-tangible that arises from the base. This is fleshed out through an understanding of reflection/mediation, homology, and tradition/institutions. The binary of base/superstructure as two separate entities is incomplete, he says, because the entity of superstructure has largely grown to encompass so much that it has lost meaning. For example, he gives the pianist/piano maker analogy, because the piano maker can be classified as &ldquo;base&rdquo; through their labor, but the pianist as &ldquo;superstructure&rdquo; because they are acting upon the base, a distinction between the status of their labor can be somehow made, which is absurd. In addition, Williams points out how the base/superstructure duality presumes that these entities are static and unchanging, while they shape each other, processes can somehow be bucketed into one or the other easily. It also ignores the temporal aspect, just as Marx argues against the overly reductionist understanding of &ldquo;theory&rdquo; and &ldquo;activity&rdquo;, examining conditions via the duality of base/superstructure presumes their existence as forces of nature, forgetting that forces can eventually shape mold themselves into this stable state. Many contemporary studies of Iraq, for example, presume the sectarian identities that exist today (Sunni/Shia/Kurd) have always existed, and begin their historical analysis from this perspective. Yet this is completely false, research of historical conditions within Iraq would tell you that these identities were not always as pronounced, and far more fluid than we would give them. Tribes who lived alongside borders would often change their identity depending on the local hegemon of the time and would find the current hardened identities to be absurd.
Williams also has the concept of &ldquo;determination&rdquo;, which seems to be a combination of the concepts about deterministic processes and reductionism. He describes determination as being aware of limits and setting of pressures, this seems to align with the idea that processes that always give you the same output given the same input are considered to be deterministic. Combined with his discussion about &ldquo;overdetermination&rdquo;, Williams seems to suggest that the base/superstructure abstraction is too leaky, things cannot be easily categorized as base or superstructure, and inputs into the base or superstructure do not guarantee the same results every time.
What does this tell us about agency as a concept? The 18th Brumaire (&ldquo;men do not make their history willingly etc etc&rdquo;) suggests that people operate similar to Galton boards (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo9Esp1yaC8). The Galton board demonstrates the normal distribution, one of the fundamental theorems of probability: random trials, repeated over and over, each with the same chance, eventually end up at the bell curve. To stretch this analogy, this is the overdetermination that Williams says, while we know that eventually, processes arrive at a stable state, each trial is messy and one can only operate on marginal probabilities.
Week 5 Agency and structuralism, and thucydides
This week&rsquo;s readings attempted to bridge the gap between pure structuralist and dissolution of everything into separate identities. Sahlins sets out in Historical Metaphors to note the differences between transformation and reproduction, and states that both processes are maximally distinguishable during culture contact (68). Borrowing heavily from linguistic evolutionary theory, cultural contact is destructive, the introduction of foreign actors in a previously hermetic system forces the system to respond by either transforming itself or reproducing previous practices at a greater rate. The act of reproduction is not totally separated from transformation in this case, for reproduction is at stake if transformations are not taken. Sahlin&rsquo;s departure from this orthodox evolutionist process is that he believes the process of transformation activates and occurs on preexisting fault lines. The Hawaiians who go supply the British even as their chiefs had announced an embargo are acting because the presence of the British has exasterbated the divine/profane/chief/villager lines, and the villagers took it upon themselves to act in their own self interest.
The presence of self interest is something we&rsquo;ve already seen with Leach, but curiously unidentified by Sahlin. The concept of Thucydide&rsquo;s trap has been vivsected, dissected, and exhumed for autopsy many times over by endless academics and pundits, but Sahlin identifies that existing systems sometimes create environments for history to be made. Without leaning into the history of great men, Sahlin provides us with a framework to attribute individual (but limited) agency within powerful (but incapable of action alone) systems.
This framework gives us the how, but not the why. Elian&rsquo;s temporary American guardians were thrust into making history due to the countervailing winds of Cuban politics and Little Havanan politics, yet we do not have a good understanding for acting the way they did. Accepting that they had the agency to shape Elian&rsquo;s fate, and by connection Cuban-American relations, why did they act to defy the US government? The answers here could range from &ldquo;being interested in generating clout from the local community&rdquo; to &ldquo;true belief that Elian was Jesus and Castro was Satan&rdquo; and all the gray inbetween. If we accept that there is at least a shred of self interest involved on the part of the Gonzalez family, possibly dominant within the range motiviations but not certainly dominant, a clear picture of transformation vs reproduction appears in the relief. Transformation, from the perspective of those not in power positions, require self interest to enact. Reproduction is the inversion, where self interest serves to continue reproduction for those in power. Elian, by serving as the point of cultural contact between Cuba and America, forced the maximal differentiation that Sahlin identifies.
Week 11 Reading Notes Intro Readings focus on how the subject is created, and what we can interrogate from that How does the techniques of living (philosphy, Christanity, medical, etc) regulate life? Dissolves all things at the alter of the construct of the self What is enlightenment Rejects the earlier framing of enlightenment as a good/bad thing that is anchored in presentism Focuses on that the achievement of enlightement is based upon the achievement of reason beyond authority But we actually need to know what authority is, and whether authority is easily distinguishable Uses of pleasure - morality and the practice of the self What is morality? refers to the real behavior of individuals in relation to the rules and values that are recommended to them, aka how they account and comply within limits that are recommended but not forced Ultimately a study in transgression of boundaries, which rules can be broken, and how can they be broken? How do we determine what is ethical? By relating your acts to what rules are considered moral Ethnical nature also works in line with establishment of the subject, your relation to the rule creates a subject &ldquo;A moral actoin tends towards its own accomplishment&rdquo; (pg 28), there is the implication jaywalking laws and red lights nyc jaywalking is geared towards the production of a certain &ldquo;new yorker&rdquo; identity we summon particular acts to produce symbols to realize ourselves as ethical subjects Reading Response A sidebar I found useful within this greater argument is the role of symbols. Signs themselves are a technology wielded to produce truth (225), acting in concert with other technologies towards the ultimate goal of the creation of subjecthood. Focault himself does not devote more time to this idea, but I think it&rsquo;s useful to consider the longevity of signs and symbols. Within the internation of morals and subjecthood that Focault describes, and signs act as the contested ground: subjects produce signs all the time, some of which end up becoming reified and anchoring morals, but morals, to be portable and communicable, must be compressed into signs. Signs are more than just verbal, they must evoke a gamut of emotions or risk becoming extinct. They must also be sufficiently malleable, a rigid sign risks falling out of discourse if the reinterpretation is too fixed. Like any good text, a powerful sign must contain contradictions within itself in order to have greater life.
This week&rsquo;s readings focused on the composition of morality, and how subjecthood is defined in relationship with morality. Referring back to Kant&rsquo;s &ldquo;What is Enlightment&rdquo; we read in week 1, Focault proceeds to break down the binary of good/bad categorization of Enlightment by attempting to focus on implicit morality contained within Kant&rsquo;s definition. If a human achieves enlightment via the usage of reason beyond authority, we should question what forms of authority are natural and what are results. Kant&rsquo;s definition builds in authority, but Focault complicates the answer by forcing us to inspect what authority is. Morality here plays a key role as well, because morality can be defined as more than the rote following of a rule, but rather a rule that produces &ldquo;its own accomplishment&rdquo; (28) towards building a self-reinforcing subject.
The evolutoinary pressure placed upon signs is therefore incredibly high. However, signs have another unique property which Focault does not describe, but Sahlins does: the reproduction of signs risks the transformation of meaning. Even more interesting, signs are composable: the combination of seemingly unrelated signs can end up creating a more powerful sign.
One example I can think of is the 1452 electrical poles between Najaf and Karbala. For Shia Muslims, the walk between Najaf and Karbala is considered a holy pilgrimage, loaded with semantic context. Years after the origination of the pilgrimage, the number 1452 has become an icon for the walk itself [1][2]. There are multiple layers of meaning at work here: electrical poles have next to zero &ldquo;pure&rdquo; religious value, and are ordinarily a mundane part of state infrastructure. Yet, held within this religious context, simple electrical poles become a religious sign, even a sign worth selling. An additional layer of semantics is added when we consider that, after 2003, electrical infrastructure in federal Iraq has been crippled, to the point where government electricity lasts 2-4 hours during the day, which force regular famlies to devote a significant part of their monthly budget to massively expensive generator power.

Week 12 Butler’s thesis that gender must be seen with its temporal element, as a construction that produces material, which is at first unstable but eventually stabilizes, through the usage of a zone of exclusion is a fascinating and recurring pattern. This mechanism of production can also be seen with the construction of citizenship. Modern liberal citizenship, which requires the explicit production of &ldquo;non-citizens&rdquo; provides a similar space. As Brubaker states, &ldquo;They are excluded not becqause of what they are but because of what they are not-because they are not recognized or acknowledged as insiders&hellip;every modern state defines its citizens postively, in accordance with explicit, formally articulated criteria, and its noncitizens residually&rdquo; (Brubaker, Citizenship as Social Closure 29).
In addition, Keller&rsquo;s intervention that the subject cannot always be considered a conscious agent (119) is especially relevant here. Citizenship, like gender, is a process that produces unevenly at start, and is not purely performative. Requiring &ldquo;bodies that fail to materialize&rdquo;, as Butler states, the women possessed that Keller describes find themselves as &ldquo;places&rdquo;. The women&rsquo;s bodies as a location where power fails to materialize, but the factory floor materializes the power of spirits provides a powerful analytic tool.
I believe state/waqf relations in contemporary Iraq can be seen in a similar way. Waqfs, at least in Islamic law studies, are one of the most contested terrains, to a point where even it failed to be settled by Sultanate decree in the Ottoman empire, and incorporated local usury practices [1]. The waqf exists as a location defined by exclusion of state regulatory practices. Post 2003, waqf regulatory practices were unstable and largely left the Najafi jurists on its own, but over time, a particular stable form has emerged, one where the waqfs are defined for what they are not, rather than for what they are [2].

Kube API basics
Core responsbilities serve the Kube API -&gt; reading/manipluating state, usually in etcd proxy cluster components HTTP Interface http interface provides 4 structures:
Kinds Type of entity, each object has a kind usually 3 categories of kinds objects -&gt; a persistent entity within the system lists -&gt; 1 or more kinds special purpose -&gt; for special actions, like status API Group collection of kinds that are logically related like /apis/core Version each API group can (and likely does) exist as multiple versions All objects are either in one API version or none Resource lowercase, plural word that identifies a set of HTTP endpoints usually sends and receives a single kind can have subrouses, usually implemented with custom HTTP protocols like websockets always corresponds to an HTTP path GVR and GVK Group Version Resource (GVR) Uniquely identifies a HTTP path Group Version Kind (GVK) what a GVR returns Special Notes api/v1 exists outside of apis as a legacy holdover, should be apis/core/v1 cluster wide entities have different values, such as /metrics, /logs, and /healthz specs vs status specifications - desired state for a resource status - observed state for a resource API server internals Each API group has a specific handler, and there are 6 different phases internally

Overview: controllers can be constructed by calling the client-go library, which provides a set of sensible defaults such as work queues and informers
https://github.com/kubernetes/client-go
most api types can be found under https://github.com/kubernetes/client-go/tree/master/listers api definitions: https://github.com/kubernetes/api
https://github.com/kubernetes/apimachinery - generic building blocks to kube-like API, not restricted to container management
most of the generic API types (ObjectMeta, TypeMeta, GetOptions, ListOptions) are in https://github.com/kubernetes/apimachinery/tree/master/pkg/apis/meta/v1 // basic client import ( metav1 &#34;k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/apis/meta/v1&#34; &#34;k8s.io/client-go/tools/clientcmd&#34; &#34;k8s.io/client-go/kubernetes&#34; ) kubeconfig = flag.String(&#34;kubeconfig, &#34;~/.kube/config&#34;, &#34;kubeconfig file&#34;) flag.Parse() config, err := clientcmd.BuildConfigFromFlags(&#34;&#34;, *kubeconfig) clientset, err := kubernetes.NewForConfig(config) pod, err := clientset.CoreV1().Pods(&#34;book&#34;).Get(&#34;example&#34;, metav1.GetOptions{}) This parses the appropriate kubeconfig and then gets the pods using the GetOptions
If you run a binary inside of a pod inside a cluster, kubelet automatically mounts a sservice account into /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount
CRUD operations are run through the XOptions, such as CreateOptions or DeleteOptions. ALl of htem are part of ObjectMeta
alpha/beta/vN verisons are what you would expect (alpha changes, beta is unlikely to break, vN is stable)
each object stored in etcd is stored as a specific version known as the storage version of that resource
anything served as a kind is a struct
all objects can be retrived and deepcopied each object stores its groupversionkind type meta https://github.com/kubernetes/apimachinery/blob/10b38829b6211c0d672e14a126479221312d3368/pkg/apis/meta/v1/types.go#L41 example of a pod declaration
type Pod struct { metav1.TypeMeta \`json:&#34;,inline&#34;\` metav1.ObjectMeta \`json:&#34;metadata,omitempty&#34;\` Spec PodSpec \`json:&#34;spec,omitempty&#34;\` Status PodStatus \`json:&#34;status,omitempty&#34;\` } Note that the type and version are not set by the user, they are set when being marshaled in the versionserializer
ObjectMeta corresponds to the metadata section in yaml rarely read or written from in client-go code, but very key to the system Client Sets gives access to multiple API groups and resources also gives access to the discovery client Status subresources each deployment has a status subresource, updatestatus uses an additional http endpoint with /status used with /apis/apps/v1beta1/namespaces/ns/deployments/name/status can change the status of an object Listing and Deletions ALlows to delete multiple objects of a namespace at once Watches Gives an event interface for all changes, returns a channel actually discouraged, should try to use informers (k8s) instead Client Options can set: the version wire format user agent (allows for debugging and better log readability) informers (k8s) and caching work queue example: https://github.com/kubernetes/client-go/blob/master/examples/workqueue/main.go premade implementation of queue for building controllers api machinery (k8s) vendoring typical golang vendoring, or modules `}),e.add({id:1279,href:"/posts/programming_languages/",title:"programming languages",content:`Tags: computers

Information is not necessarily removed removed, information at higher levels is added based on higher level principals. We &ldquo;remove&rdquo; infomration by asserting that there is some set of assumptions now on the lower level. A struct is an abstraction over raw groups, it asserts that the memory will be laid out in a specific manner, that the members of the struct behave a certain way, etc Important to establkish a number of autonomous functional units at one level before they can be connected to one functional unit at the next level
Each level of abstraction has the reasons and specifications coming from below, therefore abstractions are built from bottom-up but viewed top-down. In the case of disturbances due to technical faults, the causes of malfunction are propagating bottom-up through the hierarchy of abstraction, at the same time as rules for peroper functions are derived top-down.

Read the Damn Error Message I&rsquo;ve been working on a project for grad school, and through watching my teammates, I&rsquo;ve seen them exhibit some of the same behaviors I see juniors do. The most fustrating one is the inability to debug, or the failure to reason about debugging.\nFor example, given this traceback:\nTraceback (most recent call last): File &#34;/scratch/username/nlu/experiment-script.py&#34;, line 354, in &lt;module&gt; tot = loader(dataset_name, tokenizer, args.cache_dir) File &#34;/scratch/username/nlu/experiment-script.py&#34;, line 150, in loader tot.append(_preprocess_dataset(dataset_name, data, sentence_col, tokenizer)) File &#34;/scratch/username/nlu/experiment-script.py&#34;, line 157, in _preprocess_dataset data = data.map( File &#34;/scratch/username/envName/lib/python3.9/site-packages/datasets/dataset_dict.py&#34;, line 432, in map { File &#34;/scratch/username/envName/lib/python3.9/site-packages/datasets/dataset_dict.py&#34;, line 433, in &lt;dictcomp&gt; k: dataset.map( File &#34;/scratch/username/envName/lib/python3.9/site-packages/datasets/arrow_dataset.py&#34;, line 1407, in map update_data = does_function_return_dict(test_inputs, test_indices) File &#34;/scratch/username/envName/lib/python3.9/site-packages/datasets/arrow_dataset.py&#34;, line 1378, in does_function_return_dict function(*fn_args, indices, **fn_kwargs) if with_indices else function(*fn_args, **fn_kwargs) File &#34;/scratch/username/nlu/experiment-script.py&#34;, line 158, in &lt;lambda&gt; lambda x: tokenizer(x[&#34;input_text&#34;], padding=&#34;max_length&#34;, truncation=True), File &#34;/scratch/username/envName/lib/python3.9/site-packages/transformers/tokenization_utils_base.py&#34;, line 2210, in __call__ assert isinstance(text, str) or ( AssertionError: text input must of type `str` (single example), `List[str]` (batch or single pretokenized example) or `List[List[str]]` (batch of pretokenized examples). I&rsquo;ve seen junior engs completely ignore this traceback, thinking it&rsquo;s all garbage. Alternatively, I&rsquo;ve also heard the excuse that Python isn&rsquo;t their wheelhouse, so it&rsquo;s fine to not know how to read this, or that their area of focus is experimentation and not writing/reading/debugging code.\nBoth of these concepts are absurd. Junior engs miss a treasure trove of information when they skip the traceback. Programmers, whether as grad students or software engineers, will read a magnitude more code than they write. Learning how to debug code that you don&rsquo;t understand is simply an extension of that. CS grad students are never explicitly taught how to read a paper, yet it&rsquo;s expected for students to simply &ldquo;pick it up&rdquo; along the way. Reading and reasoning about unfamiliar code is an invaluable skill, one that allows programmers to work in a variety of environments. In hopes of fixing that, I&rsquo;m going to walk through how I would debug this particular traceback, and then talk about the mentality programmers should approach debugging with.\nExample Going back to the traceback above, I&rsquo;ll walk through my chain of reasoning and how to debug it. There&rsquo;s already many tutorials on how a traceback is structured, but I&rsquo;m going to walk through this specific one with an example.\nTracebacks is a structured logs Because tracebacks are structured logs, they should be read from the point of error, and work backwards to isolate the specific problem. In this case, the error is helpfully at the bottom, so I&rsquo;m going start by reading from the bottom up.\nRead the actual error AssertionError: text input must of type `str` (single example), `List[str]` (batch or single pretokenized example) or `List[List[str]]` (batch of pretokenized examples). This error is fairly explicit, it&rsquo;s telling us that the text input must be of a specific type. If this is unclear, the line above helpfully gives an example, stating assert isinstance(text, str) or (. So now we know that there&rsquo;s a type mismatch somewhere.\nCheck the filenames, switch the reading order Now, knowing what the error is, we need to find out where the error comes from. Now it could come from anywhere within the traceback, and there&rsquo;s a lot of information, so we need to narrow it down quickly. One of the first passes I usually do is scanning the filenames1.\nIn this traceback, we know that error line that comes from /python3.9/site-packages/datasets/ is coming from the datasets library, so we can likely discard it. Mentally, after removing all the error lines that comes out of the datasets library, we have:\nTraceback (most recent call last): File &#34;/scratch/username/nlu/experiment-script.py&#34;, line 354, in &lt;module&gt; tot = loader(dataset_name, tokenizer, args.cache_dir) File &#34;/scratch/username/nlu/experiment-script.py&#34;, line 150, in loader tot.append(_preprocess_dataset(dataset_name, data, sentence_col, tokenizer)) &lt;&lt;datasets library stuff....&gt; File &#34;/scratch/username/nlu/experiment-script.py&#34;, line 157, in _preprocess_dataset data = data.map( File &#34;/scratch/username/nlu/experiment-script.py&#34;, line 158, in &lt;lambda&gt; lambda x: tokenizer(x[&#34;input_text&#34;], padding=&#34;max_length&#34;, truncation=True), This is far more readable, and can be read top-down! Going back to the idea that tracebacks are structured logs, structured logs should be read bottom-up to identify what and where the problem is, but then logs should be read top-down to how the error occured. Reading logs top-down gives the ability to reconstruct the flow of the program itself.\nIn this case, we can see that the the loader function is called, which then calls append, which then calls into the datasets library, and then eventually calls into a map on a lambda. So now we know that there&rsquo;s something wrong with the lambda function.\nPrint it (or use pdb) At this point, it becomes unclear what&rsquo;s going on. It seems like the problem is x[&quot;input_text&quot;] has a mismatching type, but we can&rsquo;t really be sure until we have a little more debugging information. The next stage can be done by simply replacing the tokenizer call with a print call, so lambda x: tokenizer(x[&quot;input_text&quot;], padding=&quot;max_length&quot;, truncation=True becomes lambda x: print(x[&quot;input_text&quot;], type(x[&quot;input_text&quot;])).\nAt this point, the answer was that x[&quot;input_text&quot;] returned an incorrect datatype.\nDebugging Mentality The above traceback is a good example of working through the debugging mentality. The error messages will most likely tell you what the errors are, and the role of a programmer during debugging is to find out the where and the how. As a result, it&rsquo;s important to not approach debugging with a specific hypothesis. Each stage in the debugging process should give you more questions, and a programmer must use their brain in debugging. The goal of debugging is not to come in with a specific hypothesis and attempt to prove/disprove it, but rather to find the correct set of questions to answer, and gradually narrow it down. It&rsquo;s important to remain intellectually curious about how your system can behave pathologically.\nIf a programmer comes into the system with a predetermined set of hypotheses, it&rsquo;s easy to fiddle around with the code in order to (dis)prove those hypotheses. This is a very &ldquo;scientific method&rdquo; point of view, but as programmers, we luckily don&rsquo;t have to be constrained by that! The scientific process operates on information, which is why the mode and technique of inquiry is imporant. But software is both information and a process2, which means that programmers do not have to be bound in the same way. We can observe software in action, and take the logs of software to reconstruct the events, rather than testing specific conditions. As a result, it&rsquo;s important to never let your hypothesis about bugs overshadow what the error messages are saying.\nYes, I know the error is coming from directly the line above it, but I&rsquo;m going to pretend to not understand the lambda for example purposes.&#160;&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;\nBryan Cantrill said this in some talk I can&rsquo;t recall&#160;&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;\n"}),e.add({id:1337,href:"/posts/reader_and_shultz_pilgrims_until_we_die_unending_pilgrimage_in_shikoku/",title:"Reader and Shultz - Pilgrims Until We Die: Unending Pilgrimage in Shikoku",content:`rituals, japan

Notes Focuses on how eternal pilgrimage is understudied
Linkages to karbala and people there, performing mowkebs as a ritual
Uses the idea of &ldquo;permanent pilgrims&rdquo;
“We argue that Shikoku should be seen not as a unique outlier but as a manifestation of a potentially recurrent phenomenon, but one that has been rather overlooked in pilgrimage studies—namely repetition, long-term, temporally unbound, and unending pilgrimage engagement.” (Reader and Shultz, 2021, p. 231) (pdf)
Saint making is a central part of the way, the myth of Kobo Daishi and hagiography
reinteration, recurrence, unending engagement, and permanance rather than treating rituals as a &ldquo;ritualized break&rdquo; from routine (Victor and Edith Turner and Alan Morinis) Look at and write against Victor Turner
“Often as a result pilgrimage is seen as a journey away from home, something set apart from ordinary life, and an escape from or alternative to ideas of the everyday and of routines. Such emphases also project an image of pilgrimage as extraordinary and singular, a one-off rather than a repeated or repetitive activity.” (Reader and Shultz, 2021, p. 14) (pdf)
&ldquo;addictive&rdquo; nature of pilgrimage, and how it ties into idea of trance
should we seriously consider addiction? Does it relate to the idea of posession? what about the idea of salafists who do &ldquo;neurotic&rdquo; things at first glance but don&rsquo;t actually upon deeper dive in Gauvain - Salafi Ritual Purity: In the Presence of God Static pilgrims, pilgrims who end up staying in holy cities
Examples of pilgrims who become so involved in specific sites that they take up residence there—static pilgrims, as it were, continually on pilgrimage to the places of their new residence—can be found in the academic literature, such as the Hindu pilgrims cited by Diane Eck, who travel to the sacred pilgrimage city of Varanasi and then stay there until they die, and devotees of the Catholic priest Padre Pio, who journey to San Giovanni Rotondo, stay in the town, attend the shrine all the time, and become resident devotees.” (Reader and Shultz, 2021, p. 18)
Also think about Can - Spiritual Subjects, and how the ottomans attempted to craft policies which prevented people from staying in mecca and medina do people try to stay in najaf and karbala? crafting of local images, such as in the case of anastasia in Johnson - Automatic Religion
colors of robes: white used to symbolize dead for the world, while black in arbaeen
faith is questionable, some older japanese men paid little attention to it
issue of settai (begging)
some pilgrims are seen as overusing of services notably this is largely situated as part of a singular country pilgrimage temple&rsquo;s assocation as the establishment of a sendatsu system
tour groups as a social foundation, similar to walking for arbaeen
culture of &ldquo;encouragement&rdquo; - same as the mowkebs

I&rsquo;m entering my sixth year of programming this year, and like any developer, you begin to have all sorts of thoughts. This is a loose collection of major lessons I&rsquo;ve learned throughout the past five years. Funnily enough, I think most of this is not directly teachable, the majority of these lessons I&rsquo;ve arrived at by failing over and over.
Outage Driven Development I&rsquo;ve worked at two startups and one large company, and one of the startups was a cloud metrics company, so I&rsquo;ve seen my fair share of outages. There&rsquo;s a variety of things to be stated about handling an outage (SRE runbook et al), but I think it&rsquo;s important to think about how outages affect our development process. Post-postmortem period, there&rsquo;s often a frantic scramble to set up systems such that an outage doesn&rsquo;t happen again, but oftentimes the same outage never happens again. Postmortems will often identify the root cause, but more often than not, a single problem is unlikely to cause a major outage. Outages happen because problems cascade into another, spreading faster than operators expect. The often-used method of preventing future outages is to place more bureaucracy in place (feature flags! canary versions! blue/green deploys!). I&rsquo;m largely in favor of these, but having seen these cut into the release process, I&rsquo;ve soured on feature flags that require manual enablement, purely because they 1) duplicate the amount of code needed and 2) are often forgotten about after deployment is done. Removing feature flags is a non-trivial cost to the development cycle, and I end up leaning towards systems that are totally automated during the development process, such as automated sandbox tests, or replay tests in CI. I think replay tests are hugely powerful, capturing a section of live traffic and using some form of network dialogue minimization, coupled with a sandbox environment provides you with good guarantees for what your code is going to look like. Ideally, the best way to think about deploys is like a machine learning model between training and inference: you want to prevent distributional shift. The traffic you code against should be the traffic you run against, and reply testing goes a long way towards that. We should take care to not have processes that hamper developer velocity due to previous outages. Outages, while they represent useful sources of information, often get leaned on by developers as whispered taboos, things that we shouldn&rsquo;t do because they caused a problem in the past. I used to work with a group that absolutely refused to use RabbitMQ because of a single major outage 6 years ago. Oftentimes, juniors, who remain unshackled by past outages, will bring this stuff up. We should embrace that (within reason) because outages are a great experience for juniors to learn as well. I&rsquo;m very fond of bringing juniors on during an outage (not front-line, but having them participate in the actual outage and the postmortem) because outage handling is like riding a bike: I can tell you all the physics that goes into a bike, but unless you get on and fall, you&rsquo;re not going to learn.
Code Optimize for readability is an oft-repeated phrase, and I am in pretty full-throated agreement. However long you expect your code to live, take that time and double it, because the half-life of any single piece of code is going to be longer than you expect. People who say there shouldn&rsquo;t be comments are dead wrong, programming is an oral tradition, and we should use that to its full advantage. Code does not speak for itself, so we have to. I love this tweet from @mcclure111, where she says:
Since most software doesn&rsquo;t have a formal spec, most software &ldquo;is what it does&rdquo;, there&rsquo;s an incredible pressure to respect authorial intent when editing someone else&rsquo;s code. You don&rsquo;t know which quirks are load-bearing.
Designs Design docs rule. The goal of a design doc is not to capture accurate information about what a future system does, but rather to preserve the context in which a piece of code was written. Ideally, a good design doc tells you: what state systems are related to are at, what you would like the current system to be in the future, and what are potential pitfalls. This is immensely powerful, a chain of design docs provides you with the evolution of the system. Not only do design docs work by making sure everyone is on the same page before writing any code, but the long tail benefit of design docs provides better onboarding experiences since most of their questions about quirks should be answered in the RFCs.
Tools PG/Kube/Terraform/Consul/Cassandra/Protobuf/Flatbuf/GraphQL/Kafka/Rabbit/etc are all the same stuff. I don&rsquo;t even mean that cheekily, in the modern era, if your thing is not an RPC thing with a database and some special pipes in between, what are you even doing? I used to fight a lot about the particular tool, but now I&rsquo;m more in favor of just asking &ldquo;is it an RPC system, a database, or a pipe? Is any piece trying to be more than that?&rdquo;
Use code search. Not the terrible Github code search, but code search that&rsquo;s aware of syntax, like OpenGrok or SourceGraph, or whatever your company has, or whatever your IDE is. Code search will save you an immense amount of time during development and outages.

Week 2 reading response The competing narratives of secularization this week seem to be akin to blind men reaching for the elephant: each individual feels a different part, and tends project their understanding off of such. Taylor, for example, begins with by introducing the concept of &ldquo;closed world system&rdquo;, which is a relatively beign rehashing of the concept of a &ldquo;closed form solution&rdquo;. Taylor tells us that there exists internally consistent models whose abstractions may not map distinctly to the real world, yet these imperfect models are still widely adopted and lived in different ways. Gregory views one of these models as the economic model: that there exists a sufficient level of abstraction such that people can begin to see all things as something to be consumed, which in turn begins as a contagion into other spheres, leading to the secularization we see today. Berger and Casanova offer explanations aligned with the state, Berger talks about the interactions of religious insititutions and their attempts to differentiate one another upon the state managed laizze fair religious market, and Casanova ties religion to the soverignty and the decline of monarchic systems.
Yet we have still not arrived at the entire elephant. Theories about the &ldquo;curious fact&rdquo; of the Westphalian system are well discussed. Arguments about how secular nationalism replaced ethnic and religious identity for a national identity based on civic and secular norms are common, yet they are somehow orthongal to the discussion of modernity. If we limit the concept of modernization to when the state began to exert control (either directly or by creating a free market for religion), the contemporary world then offers a variety of examples on how this process is handled, from India to Uruguay to Malaysia, which would then appear to refute this freefloating idea of &ldquo;religion&rdquo; offered up by readings this week. Berger and Taylor assumed that there is a substance to religion that can be traced and compared across time and space in order to measure its shape. As Azba pointed out, there is a discontinuity between how academics theorize religion and how people make use of religion. If we think about the fact that states and people do not arbitrarily use religion, I wonder if the models proffered this week are workable.
Week 4 Reading Response This week, we&rsquo;re presented with Asad&rsquo;s seminal work on demarcating the secular and the religion, alongside the Lowith-Blumenberg debate of whether secularity is merely a transmutation of previous Christian ideas, with the encounter of modernity replacing the power inside the vacuum. Casanova blurs the lines together, repeating the metaphor of the smashing of the monestary walls, noting that both sides have seeped into one another. Duara approaches this idea from the process of identity formation, noting how religion was used a tool to reinforce or advocate for change for specific groups.
These are all good points worth considering, and we should all consider them carefully. While trying to avoid the stereotype of the grad student that tears everything down, I think we must consider the deep structures available. Duara notes that the lack of definition for what religion is allows the state to constantly breach the secular and religious spheres (204). I think the readings this week also largely fail to make proper distinctions for what they consider to be religion, reinterpreting religion to be what is absent after the arrival of secularity, as if religion can be interpretated in the wake of modernity. To me, these ideas are too fluid, and lack both proper morphologic and semantic distinctions. In tracing the geneology, Lowith, Blumenberg, and Asad all fall into the same trap, and end up tracing the genology of religious artifacts and religious people, not religion itself. Casanova has largely given up this view, accepting that the venn diagram of religion and secularity is muddy and should be tested through his three theories.
So what is religion then, if we believe that the Lowith/Blumenberg/Asad geneology is actually a historiography? Duara gives us a hint, through Reisebrodt&rsquo;s idea of &lsquo;referential legitimiation&rsquo; (199): a religion is a religion because other religions consider it to be a peer. This is an old Ferdinand de Saussure idea, who theorized that a word is a word not because of the association between the letters/sounds and meaning, but rather because a word stands in contrast to other words. The word &lsquo;cat&rsquo; is useful not because it means the literal animal, but because it is different than the word &lsquo;dog&rsquo;, or the word &lsquo;snake&rsquo;. Later linguists have refined this idea to the concepts of &ldquo;paradigmatic&rdquo; (relations among units that that occupy the same position in the stream of speech) and &ldquo;syntagmatic&rdquo; (relations among units that occur in successive speech). Applying the paradigmatic and syntagmatic concepts back to religion, Duara has already started the paradigmatic approach, looking across different religions in East and South Asia, and comparing the various similar structures. However, I think we can move towards the syntagmatic approach with a closer examination of the smaller religions. Duara leaves out how other religions felt about Sam Kauw Hwee, or the Chondogyo, or the Caodai. However, just as smaller, artificial languages allow the linguist to test their hypotheses, I think smaller religions provide a better lens to understand the encounter with modernity, because they are not subject to the same internal gravity that larger religions are bound by.
Religion and Modernity religion is not that different from modernity, it is an effective &ldquo;political settlement&rdquo;, a process where state authority is invited in to settle religious disputes, but in so doing, the state achieves greater religious control. Religion and secularism isn&rsquo;t all that different, and the state cannot effectively segregate religious freedom in sullivan `}),e.add({id:1353,href:"/posts/religious_minorities_in_iraq/",title:"religious minorities in iraq",content:`Tags: iraq

From Wiley-Blackwell Companions to Religion: The Blackwell Companion to Religion and Violence Grassroots activism is the interpretive locus of religious peacebuilding. According to Lederach, grassroots peacebuilding “means that the location of the actor and action is among the poor, the affected communities who … understand survival and change in terms of decades and generations, in terms of lifelong processes of transformation” (2003b: 262, 264). The introduction to the book Peacemakers in Action asserts that “today, it is widely accepted that religion is a cause-rather than a solution – to many of the world&rsquo;s violent conflicts. This should not be surprising … the majority of contemporary conflicts involve issues of religious, national, or ethnic identity … And religious teachings are being used to legitimize wars and all forms of brutality and violence” (Tanenbaum Center for Interreligious Understanding 2007: 3–4). `}),e.add({id:1355,href:"/posts/relocation_read_only_relro/",title:"relocation read only (relro)",content:" https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29186252 A way to mitigate attackers on the stack by mucking the global offset table location, since the GOT is located at a static place in memory makes the GOT readonly within memory Tradeoff is that it takes extra startup time "}),e.add({id:1356,href:"/posts/relu/",title:"relu",content:`Tags: ml

Any digital modulation, and more so encryption, would be the responsibility of the ground stations. This is still a common design pattern for satellites, referred to as the &ldquo;bent pipe&rdquo; model since the space segment is merely a &ldquo;bend&rdquo; with no logic, but it is subject to abuse by unauthorized operators so there&rsquo;s usually some degree of at least authentication today.
Military satellites launched into the &rsquo;80s continued to use analogue transponders and, to some extent to this day, see unauthorized use. The only real deterrent was the difficulty of obtaining inexpensive equipment for satellite bands but the widespread use of DVB and VSATs changed that during the &rsquo;90s and &rsquo;00s.
That said, all related documents may very well have been classified at the time (owing especially to the lack of any authentication!) and even when declassify-on dates pass there is often institutional resistance to going through the motions of releasing this material, especially since Lincoln Labs (a contractor) would not be authorized to do so and would have to forward the request on to someone else. A more formal FOIA request, followed by appeals if necessary, can often unstick these wheels since it creates a legal obligation that a more casual media request does not.

One particular approach to this has been work on the information plane \\cite{tishby_deep_2015}, which measures the mutual information between the input layers, output layers, and latent representations. However, as most of the work has analyzed only small neural networks, we analyze the results and speculate on . In addition, we motivate the problem space by discussing the mesa optimizer: a problem within AI alignment theory that relies on sufficient generalization.\\end{abstract} \\section{Introduction} Deep neural networks have shown impressive results across a variety of tasks, with the transformer based models \\cite{vaswani_attention_2017} such as BERT \\cite{devlin_bert_2019}, RoBERTa \\cite{liu_roberta_2019} and T5 \\cite{raffel_exploring_2020} breaking state of the art on NLP benchmarks. Research on these models have attempted to formalize the behaviors of these models, usually around the learning curve during training. Typically, a model during training is considered to have two phases, one where the model has not yet sufficiently learned and a generalization gap remains, and a phase where the model begins to over-fit and increase in test error. A variety of studies have discussed the phase transition. \\cite{merrill_effects_nodate} note that discrete structures appear within transformers during training time, where the gradients during gradient descent (GD) start to become similar to hardmaxes as training increases. Various information bottleneck (IB) papers, first proposed by \\cite{tishby_deep_2015}, note that the you can observe a sufficient generalization and overfitting occur on by plotting mutual information \\cite{shwartz-ziv_opening_2017}. This paper seeks to consolidate and summarize the findings from these sometimes conflicting approaches to measuring compression on the IP. To do this, this paper is split into two sections. The first section summarizes the work done on network saturation and the IB, with Table \\ref{sources-table} denoting the sources used for this survey. The second part discusses how the work done on network saturation relate to the work done on the IB. Our main conclusions are: \\begin{itemize} %\\item Multiple descent may only appear on datasets within a &#34;critical regime&#34;, which means that sufficiently large datasets may not exhibit this. \\item Information bottleneck principle holds true with some limitations for nearly every case of neural network tested so far. However, some limitations exist, such as compression only appearing on the information plane on particular layers. \\item Information bottleneck and mutual information measurements research is largely focused on setting theoretical bounds and have rarely been applied outside of small models. Furthermore, there is no information plane calculation for Adam optimizations. Calculating mutual information within a transformer may be a fruitful area of study. \\item While compression occurs, saturation is not guarenteed to occur in smaller settings. However, for transformer models, saturation \\textit{is} is observed for nearly all state of the art models. \\end{itemize} \\subsubsection{Related Works} We note that \\cite{geiger_information_2021} contains much of the same work surveying the information bottleneck papers, and includes some work on drawing attention to the relationship between geometric compression and the information theoretic bounds within the IB. Our work differs from \\cite{geiger_information_2021} as we highlight the role of network saturation in line with compression, as well as cites work relating to pratical applications of IB on used models. Two other surveys of IB should be brought up: \\cite{hafez-kolahi_information_2019}, which surveys the variety of information extraction methods, and \\cite{goldfeld_information_2020}, which surveyed much of the same information as \\cite{geiger_information_2021}. We contrast our work by discussing the particularities around network saturation and relating it work done on transformers, which neither of the other two papers attempt to do. \\begin{figure*}[htbp] \\label{sources-table} \\begin{tabularx}{\\textwidth}{X|X|X|X|X} \\textbf{Reference} &amp; \\textbf{Obs.

Many measures of entropy have been discovered, from discrete entropy, to differential entropy for continous random variables, to conditional entropy for conditional random variables. Discrete entropy can be defined as \\begin{equation} \\label{discrete-entropy} H(X) = -\\sum_{i=1}^{N}p_i(x)\\log p_i(x) \\end{equation} Entropy in this case satisfies three main features: it is a positive measurement, it is maximal for a uniformly distributed random variable, and deterministic distributions have a entropy of zero. Continuous entropy can be defined by replacing the sum symbol with the integral \\begin{equation} \\label{cont-entropy} H(X) = -\\int p_t (x) \\log p_t(x) dt \\end{equation} Conditional entropy can be interpreted as the average amount of information left in the random variable $X$ when the outcome of $Y$ is known. Notably, it satisfies the following properties: \\begin{itemize} \\item For any two variables $X$ and $Y$, the conditional entropy $H$ of $H(X|Y)$ is always lower than or equal to $H(X)$, or $H(X|Y) \\leq H(X)$ \\item If $X$ and $Y$ are independent, then the conditional entropies are the same: $H(X|Y) = H(X)$ \\item If $X$ is completely determined by $Y$, then $H(X|Y) = 0$ \\end{itemize} From these three properties it is possible to construct the concept of mutual information $I$: \\begin{equation} \\begin{gathered} I(X;Y) = H(X) - H(X|Y) \\\\ = H(Y) - H(Y|X) \\end{gathered} \\end{equation} $I(X;Y)$ implies: \\begin{itemize} \\item If $X$ and $Y$ are independent, then $I(X;Y) = 0$ \\item If $X$ and $Y$ have some non-deterministic statistical relationship, then $I(X;Y)$ captures the relationship that can be accounted for without random chance \\item If $X$ and $Y$ are deterministic in relation by $f(X) = Y$, then $H(Y|X) = 0$ and $I(X;Y) = H(Y)$ \\end{itemize} \\subsection{Information Bottleneck Principle} The information bottleneck (IB) was first described by \\cite{tishby_deep_2015}, where for random variables (RVs) $X$ and $Y$, there exists a maximally compressed representation $T$. For two RVs with a statistical dependency on each other, $T$ is always assumed to exist. A Markov chain of T-X-Y can then be drawn with the joint probability distribution that: \\[p(X,Y,T) = p(T|X)p(Y|X)p(X) \\] Assuming each hidden layer of the neural network is $T_{n}$, the combination of encoder layers can be modeled as predicting $P(T|X)$, whereas the decoder layers predict $P(Y|T)$ \\cite{shwartz-ziv_opening_2017}. By reusing the mutual information defined \\ref{mutual-information}, a few properties around $T$ can be formalized: \\begin{itemize} \\item $I(Y;T)$ describes the \\textit{accuracy} of a representation \\item $I(T; X)$ provides the \\textit{compression} or \\textit{complexity} of a representation. \\end{itemize} Given these two measurements, it is possible to construct an information plane (IP) plotting $I(X; T)$ and $I(Y; T)$, such as \\ref{fig:neuron-ip}. \\begin{figure} \\begin{tikzpicture} \\begin{axis}[ xlabel=$x$, ylabel={$I$} ] \\addplot {x^2 - x +4}; \\end{axis} \\end{tikzpicture} \\caption{Caption} \\label{fig:neuron-ip} \\end{figure} Using the training epoch parameter $t$, the IP can be used to examine the two distinct phases: the first, a $fitting$ phase, where $I(X;T)$ and $I(Y;T)$ both increase as the model learns to fit to the target, and then a $compression$ phase, where $I(X; T)$ decreases, but $I(Y;T)$ remains about the same, until reaching a point of \\textit{overfitting}, where $I(Y;T)$ drops. In otherwords, the critical phase transition on the regular learning curve is when $I(Y;T)$ begins to decrease. % discuss how only saxe found it, but actually this may be an incorrect measurement of mutual information In \\cite{shwartz-ziv_opening_2017}, the authors observed these two phases occuring for all their experiments. Saxe et all in \\cite{saxe_information_2019} found that there was no compression to be to be observed on the IP for a ReLU MLP network trained with either SGD and BGD. The authors of \\cite{noshad_scalable_2018} note that there were differences in estimates of MI between the \\cite{saxe_information_2019} and \\cite{shwartz-ziv_opening_2017} and offer a new way of estimating MI, proposing a linear complexity estimator of MI, and their estimation of MI finds that ReLU networks to show a compression phase. The authors of \\cite{wickstrom_information_2019} use a different, kernel based estimator where they find compression within the softmax layer of a CNN with three convolutional layers and two fully connected layers of width $400-256$ trained on MNIST. \\cite{wickstrom_information_2019} also shows how compression occurs for all layers in a $1000 - 20 - 20 - 20$ MLP trained on MNIST. Given that all networks investigated in \\cite{wickstrom_information_2019} showed some form of compression, and that the work done in \\cite{noshad_scalable_2018} refutes the only case where compression is \\textit{not} observed, IB theory holds and may have further applications, albiet on particular layers. % discuss how to actually calculate mutual information As described above, measurements of mutual information within DNNs are not exact, as they are a result of the estimation process and inherit uncertainty related to the process itself \\cite{chelombiev_adaptive_2019}. In addition, mutual information can be estimated in a variety of ways \\cite{noshad_scalable_2018}, \\cite{poole_variational_2019}, \\cite{davis_network_2020}, \\cite{gabrie_entropy_2019}, \\cite{shen_information-theoretic_2020}, which further increases the uncertainties around estimating mutual information. Fundamentally, all estimators of mutual information lie around that if mutual information between $T$ and $X$ were to be defined as \\begin{equation} \\begin{gathered} I(T;X) = H(T) - H(T|X) \\end{gathered} \\end{equation} and from \\ref{cont-entropy} $H(T|X)$ from \\cite{chelombiev_adaptive_2019} can be defined as \\begin{equation} \\begin{gathered} H(T|X) = - \\int p_t(t) \\log p_t(t) dt = -\\infty \\end{gathered} \\end{equation} As a result, the mutual information becomes infinite. In order to solve this problem, \\cite{shwartz-ziv_opening_2017} note the importance of adding noise to the process, confirmed by \\cite{saxe_information_2019}. Noise $Z$ can be added to $T$ as either a Gaussian mixture or or by discretizing into bins, resulting in the noisy variable $\\hat{T} = T + Z$, which then transforms the condition entropy to $H(T|X) = H(Z)$, and MI becomes $I(\\hat{T};X) = H(\\hat{T}) + H(Z)$. If the noise is added is Gaussian, then a kernel density estimator could be used to estimate the mutal information. If descritized into bins, then the noise arises as part of the discretization process. As \\cite{chelombiev_adaptive_2019} specifically note, DNNs with double-sided saturating activation functions are not as sensitive to estimation differences in mutual information, but non-saturating activations may or may not show compression depending on how MI is defined. \\cite{shen_information-theoretic_2020} describe a framework for estimation of entropy between layers. The authors formalize the entire data available in a CNN as a four dimensional array $dCNN(X, L, C, T)$, where $X$ is the input data, $L$ is the layer dimension, $C$ is the convolutional filters, and $T$ is the epoch number. Using a CNN trained on MNIST and CIFAR-10, they use this four dimensional representation to track information flow by estimating change in entropy between layers. \\cite{shen_information-theoretic_2020} sidesteps the MI estimation debates by simply measuring entropy, which may prove to be far more tractable in terms of larger networks. The authors also note that they wish to apply their methods to transformer-based models and RNNs in the future. % Generally, when considering mutual information in DNNs, the analyzed values are technically the result of the estimation process and, therefore, are highly sensitive to it.- chelombiev_adaptive_2019 % mutual information is not easy to estimate % discuss how none of these are very deep, and concerns with calculating mutual information beyond a certain amount For all five papers that discussed IB, only two papers implemented something other than a multilayer perceptron (MLP) \\cite{noshad_scalable_2018} \\cite{shen_information-theoretic_2020}. Furthermore, for all the papers that implemented an MLP, the network itself was fairly deep and parameters were very small, never going beyond 5 layers. As a result, it is unclear how well bound holds with larger neural networks. To be the best of the authors knowledge, \\cite{shen_information-theoretic_2020} has been the only paper which has attempted to formalize IB for larger networks. \\subsection{Network Saturation} \\cite{chelombiev_adaptive_2019} uses two types of adapative estimation schemes for mutual information (MI). For both approaches, they find that compression is always present, even when saturation does not. The authors note that compression does not always happen at later stages in the training, but often occurs from intialization depending on network archiecture. They also note that the activation function plays a role in not only whether compression does occur, but how compression occurs. As discussed above, while \\cite{saxe_information_2019} notes that single-sided saturating nonlinearities or linear activation functions do not yield compression, \\cite{noshad_scalable_2018} argues that \\cite{saxe_information_2019} contained a poor measurement of MI, and found that ReLU networks do show compression. Nevertheless, all authors agree that double-sided nonlinearities such as $tanh$ or $sigmoid$ exhibit compression phases. \\cite{merril_effects_nodate} note that as parameters grow within training for a transformer network, the network approaches an discretized network with saturated activation functions. The authors find that internal representations of pretrained transformers approximate saturated networks, while randomly initialized transformers do not. Specifically, they find that for T5 \\cite{raffel_exploring_2020}, they establish that the parameter $\\ell_2$ norm grows during training for every transformer-based model. As the $\\ell_2$ grows during training, divergence between the parameters leads to a saturated network, where the softmaxes of each layer begin to minimic hardmaxes. \\section{Discussion} The information bottleneck (IB) principle provides a potentially fruitful area of research when it comes to analysis of neural networks. One of the main areas of difficulty for measurement of IB is the information plane (IP) behaviors are reliant on estimators of mutual information (MI), which are subject to artifacts during the estimation process. %Despite there being close relationships between the information plane (IP) and learning rates, no research exists where the effects are compared. Given the variety of methods that can be used to calculate mutual information (MI) $I$, it would seem important to validate MI with a learning curve on a model. For example, in the given case of the double descent small model \\cite{nakkiran_deep_2019} figure 9, where the intermediate and large models exhibit double descent at higher epochs \\textit{after} initially appearing to overfit, it would be expected that the IP plot would exhibit similar behaviors, where $I(Y;T)$ would decrease, then eventually increase again. %In addition, \\cite{merrill_effects_nodate} find that the parameter norm growth also occurs during the training process, before the model begins to overfit. If there were a measure of MI for transformers, where \\cite{chelombiev_adaptive_2019} develops a more robust form of estimating mutual information, which then showed that compression within the IP is dependent on the activation function used and notes that saturation of the activation function is not required for compression. Like all the IB papers, the networks analyzed in \\cite{chelombiev_adaptive_2019} were very small multilayer perceptrons for tractability purposes. However, given a weak relationship could be found between saturation and compression, combining this work with \\cite{merrill_effects_nodate} may offer new insights on how transformers learn, even without a robust measurement of MI due to tractability purposes. For a large DNN, \\cite{shen_information-theoretic_2020} provides the most tractable usage of Within learning theory, it is possible to estimate the generalization error bounds of a learning algorithm. As IB formalizes into a learning algorithm, it is possible to construct the generalization error for a given neural network during training, which would prove useful for network analysis. In \\cite{shamir_learning_nodate}, the authors describe mutual information as a measure of performance, providing the example of a document classifier. The authors state that the likelihood of misclassifying a particular document using its words as a sample of points has a strict upper bound, leading to a quantified measure of generalization error. Given it remains difficult and ambiguous to calculate MI for high dimensions \\cite{poole_variational_2019}, if a correlation to IB could be found or approximated with the measurement of norm growth, then it may be possible to approximate the generalization error. The relationship between saturated neural networks and IB, alongside how transformers in some cases are already saturated may suggested a useful meeting point for newer studies. % include your own bib file like this: \\bibliographystyle{acl} \\bibliography{refs.bib} \\end{document} "}),e.add({id:1410,href:"/posts/schedulers/",title:"schedulers",content:`computers

Radood Radood notes, March 24th, 2022 - Shia center for Karabala Studies
Interviewee: Radood Muntazir al-Husseini He is 31 years old, started since he was 10 Originally from baghda%d Process of Performing Preparation, one has to pick the qasidas One has to do wudu, and be spiritually clean and pure The audience looks to the radood as a holy representative Qualities that distinguish a radood? Age is not a factor (also described by the Karbala Radoods School at Husseinya al Yassine at Mohammad Amin Street (حسينية ال ياسين في شارع محمد الامين)) Very important to pick the rhythm and lyrics Lyrical choice depends on the theme of the event There are 8 themes (maqam) https://alkafeel.net/news/index?id=14391&amp;lang=en Example themes: Saba, ajam, etc Each theme has different branches, which total over 350 When Muntazir started, he used qasids from famous ones, before he had poets to write for him There is a sub-industry of the poets and the writers, each of whom support each other Sometimes you ask a poet based on the theme, sometimes a poet sends you ones to perform if you are famous Has given radoods all over the world (Bahrain, Lebanon, Iran, Kuwait,Iraq) Pointed out that when he went to Lebanon, they didn&rsquo;t understand the idioms Radoods typically follow three ways: Start with a slow beat Go with a faster beat End with one like a &ldquo;pop song&rdquo; and loud How many radoods are there in Iraq? (jokingly) more radoods than attendees There&rsquo;s no exact number, but Muntazir describes that Iraqis have a sad voice, which is what people often look for in radoods How do you feel about the changes such as the al-shur stuff post 2011? Latmiyas change with time, but the new stuff is going both ways Positive: More accessibility due to digital videos Negative: More people are focusing on the rhythm People like Bassim Karbalei have kept pace with changes People like Mullah Jayyid have preferred to keep the old ways, which has casued him to drop in popularity Why do people focus on rhythms more than lyrics? lyrics are hard to transplant, rhythms are easier Are changes happening at a faster pace? yes, previously radoods were not very good and relied on memorization and were often illiterate new tools have helped develop this, more educated and more academic as time has gone on How do you learn to become a radood? there are scholarly rawdids largely about the structure of the throat main ways young age, realize you have a good voice, and then eventually you carve out a path you can also go learn at one of the many schools apprenticeships, now there are many out there Who funds the radood schools? All radood schools are private Radood notes, March 26, 2022 - Shia Center for Karbala Studies
Interviewee: Radood Muntazir al-Husseini, who is at the Karbala Center Describes how there is a &ldquo;comission from wealthy people&rdquo; to the radood school, which supports all over Iraq Definitely not a waqf, and not associated with the 3ttaba There are radood schools in Baghdad, Karbala, Basra, Nasriya, Kut/Ammara In baghdad, there is a big one in Kathimya and another in Sadr City The Kathimyya one seems to produce more radoods now than the Karbala school https://alkafeel.net/news/index?id=11772&amp;lang=en seems to describe the radood commission Turkmen radoods as well seem to have their own thing going up in the north, probably worth validating Radood commission is fully private, confirmed by Ali Tekmaji at the international relations part of the Hussein shrine One of the main responsibilities of the commission is to issue licenses and certifications for radoods to perform outside of Iraq Within Iraq, anything goes, anyone can perform at a specific place Interview with Ali Tekamji, March 26, 2022 - International Media Office at the Hussein Shrine
In Karbala city, during the 3rd of Muharram to the 9th of Muharram
Each one has a radood, and the songs are often about the electricity, or the services
around ~20 groups, each with 100 people
The professor from the shrine has his own mokeb, I was wondering if he has any ones related to that, since he&rsquo;s a native karbali
Ask the professor and mustafa again? 2PM shrine has a choir, Hussein shrine is &ldquo;Mullah Sahib al-Karbalai&rdquo;
The shrine is purchasing land around it, and all the land around it was previously private
Interview with mokeb administrator - March 27th, 2022
There does seem to be a certification process &lt;PICTURE OF THE ID&gt; Husseinyya Differences between Lebanon husseinyyas and Iraqi husseinyyas Lebanese ones allow politics but the Iraqi ones don&rsquo;t? Need to validate this claim Husseinyas are different than mosques, husseinyas can comprise of a mosque and a place of prayer, but also is a place to rituals and practice, broader in scope Qasida قصيدة some poets compose only for specific Radoods, Bassim Karbalaei, for example, supposedly receives qasidas in the middle of the night and free wheels it in the morning As a Pilgrimage &ldquo;As a poetic project, the notion of pilgrimage induces Indonesian Muslims to travel to Ḥ aḍramawt by framing such a journey as a transformative process.”
The iraqi shia also have a deep understanding of this, because they say the spiritual rewards for the pilgrims are high, shifts from being consumers to producers, because crying at a majilis al-aza reflects an re-enactment of a different time, similar to ta&rsquo;zieh
Ali Al-Wardi “Ali Al- Wardi (1913-1995), is one of the main pioneers of Iraqi sociology. In his book Lamahat Ijtimaiyya min Tareekh Al-Iraq Al-Hadith (1971), he focused on the nature of the emergence and structure of modern Iraqi society since the Ottoman era until the end of the twentieth century. Al- Wardi builds an argument to demonstrate that the beating celebration (Majalis Al-Latm) and the processions of Al-Hussein (Al-Mawakib Al-Husseinyya) in Iraq during the nineteenth century onward appeared for the first time in Al- Kadhumya city”
Extra thoughts Most focus on the economy of mourning, and of crying What about morning as a political force? Transformation of mourning from mourning the dead and occupying a state into political action, how does this happen? Places to take this: in Sadr city? in Karbala city? What is my intervention?

Summary There is no logical spatial, or chronological, limit to the ‘War on Terror’. Complete opposite of Anderson&rsquo;s imagined communities Yet in the West’s contemporary conflicts people’s reception of events, including battles, through the lens of their personal experience does matter to the conflict’s outcome. Why? Why do personal experiences matter here, when we tend to percieve things as part of a giant neoliberal machine? Related Articles https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/doi/epub/10.1080/01402390.2018.1529567?needAccess=true Introduction Looks for distinction between the use of armed force within a military domain that seeks to establish military conditions for a political solution (traditional war) vs use of armed force that directly seeks a political outcome Definition of stragetic audiences In clauswitzian war, there are two audiences, each poliarzed on either side victor imposes a narrative on the loser &ldquo;should these audiences beyond the enemy matter to the strategist in terms of the conflict&rsquo;s outcome, strategy needs to consider military actions in terms of their likely political intepretations by these various audiences&rdquo; moasic conflicts like afghanistan and iraq need to be thought not as two, but a multitude of audiences military actions are therefoire politicized, the boundary between military and political activity is blurred in counter-insurgency, to invervene in a fight without having antipiated hte political risks and opportunities is to misunderstand the nature of the conflict the control of the political space is as important, if not more important, than controlling the physical space contemporay conflict exaggerates the distinction between traditional war and counter-insurgency &ldquo;there is no logical spatial, or chronological, limit to the &lsquo;War on Terror&rsquo;&rdquo; - 3% into Liberal powers blur the conceptual boundaries between war and peace is often to militarise in a polarizeed manner pres-established patterns of political activity, which may not be part of the wider conflict - 4% &ldquo;sectarianism&rdquo; Chinese aid was actually given to the sri lanka in the final stage of the conflict against the tamil tigers 1 - The Language of War If the &lsquo;vernacular of battle&rsquo; is technically military proficiency, the language of war is what links the use of force to a political meaning. The lanugage of war in this sense is not war poetry or its equivalent; it describes the interpretive structure that &lsquo;war&rsquo; provides to give meaning to the use of force, just as actual language gives particular meaning to a given sound or script
5% Asks us to reconsider a frame of battle between two opposing engagements you can see it as the one company did this, another company did that, enemy responded with another this framing shows an evolution of the military situation, success/failure is judged according to one&rsquo;s position with the enemy Yet this is a very narrow basis for understanding, fails ot incoporate the possibily of a personal response being the basis for a poltiical viewpoint the soldiers can &ldquo;win&rdquo;, but members of the audience will interpret this in their own manner villagers have their view taliban have their own view &ldquo;we cannot not communicate&rdquo; from Paul Watzlawick, &ldquo;Principals of Problem Formation and Problem Resolution&rdquo; &ldquo;Ecology of mind&rdquo; - Gregory Bateson &ldquo;time matters in interpretation of conflcit&rdquo; - 8% makes an analogy towrads finance, long term investment does not expect decisive short term gain war tends to associate with brutal, finite outcomes counter insurgency is a long term investment, like ddr What is war good for? Clauswitz says war has some kind of rationale because it is a human phenomon, but rational not need be &ldquo;rational&rdquo; in a human sense &ldquo;War go beyond the boundaries of individual experiences because it is an aggregated activity, what unifies individual experiences into &lsquo;war&rsquo; is the association with the clash of organized violence. In this sense, while policy intentions of either side will shape war, war has its own independent existence, formed through reciprocal violent clash&rdquo; - 8% if war is an aggregated experience bound together by violence requiring long term investment, the opposite is true of reintegration, this is a long term investment that requires understanding individual experiences bound together by negative peace. Especially wrt to counter insurgency and the accidental gurriella Clauswitz talks about war in the &lsquo;means&rsquo; Means referrs to Clauswtiz&rsquo;s dictum that war is an extension of policy, and is organized violence itself Second sense is that war as a phenomomen is a political instrument war is not necssarily associated with violence, the continuation of war with blockades, smugging, arms trafficking, control, etc to understand war == violence requires broader analysis &ldquo;the political, social, and economic dynamics that precede wars, and cause them, continue to operate in war; any analysis which only recgonise periods of actual violence as &lsquo;war&rsquo; will be limited in their conceptual boundaries&rsquo; - 9% &ldquo;if force is a &rsquo;language&rsquo;, war is the interpreter who acts as a medium between the speaker and the listener&rdquo; war provides a unified intepretive template for the understanding of violence why did we kill X people? Why did Y people die for? Polarized war provides for this meaning, but counter insurgency, with limitless ends fails to give a good logos meaning, allowing the pathos to take over DDR deals with the physical imprint of violence, but the way war is perceived in political terms is what gives force political utility any conflict that ends with anything less than the total defeat of the enemy war can blow stuff up, but how that is interpreted is what matters (unless you completely destroy the enemy and can fill the void with completely your own narrative) Each person interprets war for their own ends sometimes this is aligned, Falklands war, same time and space for both sides basic political problems remain unresolved today does the PMF and Iraqi gov aligned for IS defeat, but the political problems remain thinking about DDR on the physical stuff we build is not complete Key point: war cannot be a single interpretive structure because war does not have an independent authority to adjudicate its own outcome war as a &lsquo;judge&rsquo; is flawed because this requires understanding of war from a disconnected and self-referencing military domain, wherein armed forces fight each other clauswitz calls this a legal trial, but there is no judge in modern war defeat is not a verdict handed out by an independent arbitrator Must not confuse the mutal acknowledgement of a battle&rsquo;s meaning with the idea that war provides a single interpretive structure - 12% cannot submit to war in the abstract sometimes both sides can have symmetrical rules this does not mean both things are the same only true singular structure is absolute war asymmetric interpretive structures, like the vietnam war hezbollah and israel in 2006 2 - Clausewitzian War and Contemporary Conflict British believed some actors in afghanistan changed sides, they did not, they simply remained on their own side reciprocal escalation of violence, which were unconstrained by bilataral state structures which serve to channel and contain violence, has unnecessarily created enemies for the coalation and catalysed the insurgency in its earlier phases Kilcullen - Out of the Mountains &ldquo;the cateogry of people who are most ruthlessly exploited by subscription to a polarised conception of the conflict are often the foreign jihadists&rdquo;- 16% Knocks against the idea of polarity Clauswitz elucidated that war started with defense, and that there was poliarty between attack and defense, the attacker and defender understanding force as a type of language &ldquo;Without polarity, force loses decisive political meaning&rdquo; - 18% without clear understanding of the enemy, force is just regular violence Bosnian conflict in the 1990&rsquo;s UN failed to achieve any decisive outcome NATO shaped the battlefield in kosovo because it made prevention a clear case of right v wrong Different than afghanistan, because in kosovo two actors already existed, whereas afghanistan has many actors already &ldquo;Clauswitz war retained utility through reconfiguration and evolved frequently&rdquo; - 21% presupposes the idea of polarity and the idea that stragetic audiences in war are primarily contained within the states at war Contemporary warfare is not between two actors, and makes it difficult for war to function as a political instrument 3 - Globalization and Contemporary Conflict Challenges Proliferation of stragetic audiences betsides the enemy Tendency for conflicts to be drawn further away from the pole of &lsquo;pure polarity&rsquo; as strategy tends to be increasingly sensitive to opinions of global audiences Strategy does not work when used on an audience who subscribes to a different conception of war 2006 lebanon israel war 23% This informs the paradox in counter-insurgency that the &lsquo;best weapons don&rsquo;t shoot&rsquo; (from US army/marine corps field manual). The death of an insurgent can create many more insurgents
Not a matter what you think, but what your audiences think Similar to a market, which is an interpretive structure that functions to provide a specific type of meaning (a price) on a product. When the market cannot provide a price, the mechanism breaks down. Similarily, when an force cannot provide a predictable effect, it makes it difficult to use. The taliban is a franchise movement - 25% Kalyvas - The Logic of Violence in Civil War 4 - Strategic Dialogue and Political Choice Tactical action does not have direct political significane Political outcome of a conflict is the accumulated outcome of innumerable individual actors as opposed to decisive blows - 29% &lsquo;moasic conflict&rsquo; - dr conrad crane - https://warontherocks.com/2014/09/observations-on-the-long-war/ In many contemporary conlficts, the levels of war are flattened Seqential vs culumative strategies sequential -&gt; island hopping in WW2 cumulative -&gt; wider defense of the pacific most politics is complicated, it is normal, and it is inherently unpredictable liberal powers broadly recgonize they are in it for perception and ideas, but then proceed to think in purely state terms antinarcotics in afghanistan 5 - Liberal Powers and Strategic Dialogue Liberal powers tend to organize strategic dialogue but does not adjust policy in response Huntington&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Soldier and the State&rdquo; Understands the solider as a pure exector of policy Strategic dialogue produces strategy that situates the desire of policy in the possibility of its execution Juncture between desire and possbility - 36% NATO 2005 plan was adjusted Clauswtiz describes war&rsquo;s &ldquo;explosive&rdquo; quality, that it forces both into a escaltory actions War&rsquo;s grammar - the relationship between the uncerteainties of violent clashes 6 - Pragmatism and Operational Thought Counter insurgency is not a strategy
Counter insurgency is a operational approach, a method to organize actions towards a strategy, but not eh strategy itself Strategy connections an operational approach to its ends, the objectives of policy, and adjusts both military domain is an extension of policy

No tool inherently possesses the ability to deliver an effect. Thus effects are simply that&ndash;effects, usually on people&ndash;they are neither &lsquo;kinetic&rsquo; nor &rsquo;non-kinetic&rsquo;, However, the default idea that one should &lsquo;balance&rsquo; violent and non-violent means in counter-insurgency is commonplace. Why, in abstract, should one arbitrarily want to balance the use of two tools?
8 - Strategic Narrative Any stragetic narrative must have emotional resonance strategy relates action to policy stragetic narrative can vary, like a salesman pitches a product differently. The problem is when a product is pitched so differently that it loses credability - 55% war is a mixure of different conflicting stories Rashid: The Way Out of Afghanistan must avoid understanding war in purely rational terms rational narrative does not have purcahse on the emotional substance of what it seeks to describe cannot claim legitamcy irony tends to identify the gap between the rational and the emotional logos (rationality), pathos (emotion), and ethos (morals) need to be aligned when they are not, pathos threatens to subsume the logos when the strategic audience no longer cares about the narrative because the narrative no longer has emotional legitmacy, the emotional response produces a new rationale contemproray conflict is characterized by the proliferation of audiences beyond the enemy now connected 7 - British Strategy in the Borneo Confrontation indonesia supported some rebels against malaysia british troops needed to be called to counter act 4 phases indonesia provided aid to the rebels who lead to the brunei revolt of 1962 indonesian volunteers led guerrilla forces in 1963 conflict proper began after the formation of malaysia, september 16th 1963 peace feelers in 1965 simpson argues that the british were largely pragmatic, they kept conflict in low grade, did not engage in overt occupation, and threatened back with positioning if needed argues that this is difficult to replicate in today&rsquo;s high information environment 9 - Ethos, Vision and Confidence in Strategic Narrative Ethos stablizes and insulates strategic effect

the most dangerous moment for an insurgency is often when it has to convert to a conventional force finally to topple the state forces; since conventional high-intensity battle is far more complex and resource intensive than guerrilla warfare, insurgencies often fail at this point. The Mujahideen here are not the only example of this; note the same phenomon with the Tamil Tigers.

Conclusion Question of &ldquo;Should we intervene in country X&rdquo; is rarely semantically challenged
When war fails to clearly separate the military and the political, organized violence in human affairs is not contained

theory is necessary in the sense that it transmits what has worked in the past in distilled form; it is a bridge to access historical experience vicariously. Yet theory is really only a springboard of ideas which should be grounded in the experience of a particular situation

Summary Religion and nationalism can be carved into 3 sections:
Civil-Religious Religious Nationalism Secular Nationalism Can further be divided into stable and unstable components
Introduction Model Religion-state ideological links Religion-state institutional links Secular nationalism Weak to nonexistent Separation Religious nationalism Strong (with a particular group) Multiple religion-state contacts (to a particular group) Civil-religious nationalism Supportive (to religion in general) Benign separation or pluralistic accomodation Launa of studies when it comes to nationalism and religion Historically Modenrists focus their attention on the role of language, the print media, and educational system Gellner notes &ldquo;curious fact&rdquo;

Rather, you will try to learn as efficiently as possible so you can quickly get to the point where actual open questions arise, as these are the only questions worth writing about.
Key takeaways: make fleeting notes and project notes, review the fleeting notes and file the project notes accordingly. Fleeting notes should be for when things pop into your mind, although I somewhat use things for this purpose as well. Project notes are for long term storage.
Work on different things at once! The slip box has the information, let blockages be free somewhere career advice else!
When cutting things from a piece of writing, make a second note that contains the things cut. Usually not needed, but contains any additional information that may be useful for reference later on.
Make fleeting notes that are reviewed Review these notes within a day Separate these notes into the ones for reference (in zotero) or somewhere else. Use full sentences, disclose sources, make references and try to be precise Fleeting notes are for capturing ideas quickly, but should be reviewed later &ldquo;Even doctoral students sometimes just collect de-contextualised quotes from a text – probably the worst possible approach to research imaginable. This makes it almost impossible to understand the actual meaning of information.&rdquo; (Sönke Ahrens, How to Take Smart Notes) &ldquo;Another habit of the effective thinkers they highlight is their ability to focus on the main ideas behind the details, to grasp the gist of something.&rdquo; (Sönke Ahrens, How to Take Smart Notes) Learning in a way that generates real insight is accumulative Taking smart notes is the precondition to break with the linear order. For every document I write, I have another called “xy-rest.doc,” and every single time I cut something, I copy it into the other document, convincing myself that I will later look through it and add it back where it might fit. `}),e.add({id:1474,href:"/posts/source_explorers/",title:"source explorers",content:`computers, coding tools

concerned with cultural divergence
how much of idiosyncratic ideas are gathered before they become mainstream?
Complex cultural practices are the accretion of one small innovation after another—the products of decades or centuries of small cultural mutations. But if these practices emerge randomly, their persistence is anything but random. Like biological traits, cultural traits are subject to selection. Rituals, beliefs, and attitudes, hunting, foraging, and farming techniques, property and kin systems, clothing and decorations, any and every aspect of a lifeway has a potential effect on fitness of the individual who practices them. If a cultural practice increases the likelihood that the person who practices it will live, thrive, and raise up the next generation of practitioners, then it will survive
Offers up the idea that cultural practices are evolutionary in nature

Stedman, Stephen John, and George Downs, eds. “Evaluating Issues in Peace Implementation.” In Ending Civil Wars: The Implementation of Peace Agreements. Boulder, Colo: Lynne Rienner, 2002.
Peace implementation differs based on peace environment, including three major factors
Presence of spoilers Hostile neighboring states Resources available for extraction (resource curse) UN has only succeeded in the least challenging environments
How do we measure success?
measurement by mandate achievement can be worked around by setting modest mandate goals nations can also offload impossible tasks to the UN does not ask any questions about the appropriateness of the mandate conflict reduction, disputant resolution, etc variety of metrics can be evaluated how/what is the appropriate ensemble difficulty in ascribing a casual relationship to the mission can success be measued by looking @ subgoals?
likely to be biased towards ascribing a clean casual relationship i.e. human rights watch is more likely to say the failure of human rights causes problems mission success as:
end of large scale violence sustainable peace in wartime certain regions are off limits (less in Asia, never in a P5 country, avoids civil war in countries with large armies)
issues with success
# of warring parties absense of pre-signed peace agreement liklihood of spoilers collapsed state # of soldiers disposable natural resources hostile neighboring states wars of succession conclusion: important to think about the metrics that we think of as &ldquo;successful&rdquo;

It&rsquo;s about modling the subject, and divination&rsquo;s usefuless is breaking out of the low energy wells that you find yourself trapped in but do not have the correct incentive structures to escape.
Why divination? Take particulary paths and reach for less casual identitives
Semi-random systems can often appear to be random but true randomless is quite difficult
On molding the subject and randomness, the goal of randomness is that it has two opposite effects: it can help continue molding the subject by speeding up processess of belief, but it can also serve to dislodge abstractions
If you&rsquo;ve already abstracted a certain amount into attributing to randomness, then it takes on a different register, i.e. Iranian man seeing a froeigner in a cosmopolitian city
But undertaking a pilgrimage places you in a mood to read extra into randomness, effective pattern matching?
Divination as an RNG generator, although the usefulness of the RNG is not that it purely adds entropy to our lives, which I think tech people usually dissolve things in the acid vat of randomness much like how humanities students do the acid vat of focualt or power, but rather the RNG generator shows us slack in different systems. The ability to introduce RNG allows for us to explore the unknown unknowns

Neoliberalism and neoliberalization are two topics that barely need introduction. Neoliberal policies affect everday lives of most people across the world. Neoliberalization the process, broadly identified to be coincident with the rise of the Bretton Woods institutions and the dominance of a globalized financial system, has faced dramatic upheaval since the fall of the Soviet Union. No introduction to these topics is possible without mentioning Francis Fukyama&rsquo;s &ldquo;The End of History?&rdquo; and John Williamson&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Washington Consensus&rdquo;. But these are two different things, neoliberalism is comprised of ideas, while neoliberalization is comprised of policies. As a result, neoliberalism is hard to pin down, while neoliberalization is far easier to see.
Here, we will attempt to define neoliberalism through an examination of the neoliberization policies of Iran. Iran presents an unique lens to understand neoliberalism due to its position relative to the United States and Europe, the two key drivers of the post-Cold War neoliberal consensus.
When Fukyama wrote &ldquo;The End of History&rdquo;, he lived at the apogee of neoliberal triumpalism. With the fall of the Soviet Union consigning the model of planned economies into dust, neoliberal policies developed two decades prior were left, or as Margaret Thatcher put it, &ldquo;There is no alternative&rdquo;.
The Reagan/Thatcher era policies, continued through successive administrations, pioneered the Washington Consensus. Privitization of national resources combined with deregulation became the leading export of Washington and London to the Global South. Helmed by international organizations such as the International Monetary Fund (who is always de facto lead by an European) and the World Bank (whose president is de facto an American), these policies cohered under the umbrella of &ldquo;structural adjustment&rdquo;, or demanding states privitize and deregulate in exchange for loans and technical support.

With over 100,000 mobilized and 40 different armed groups of all stripes united under this banner, the PMF played a pivotal role in countering the offensive by IS, ultimately leading to the liberation of Mosul in 2017 and its declared defeat in 2018.
Groups within the PMF decided to contest in the 2018 elections under the newly established Fatah party, marking a watershed moment on the path to reintegration of these irregular armed forces. While this transition has dramatically shifted the Iraqi political landscape, literature on Iraq and the PMF tend to be shaped by the two major dominant analytical frameworks used by scholars of Iraq: ahistorical primordialism or reworked ethno-symbolism footcite:dodge_bourdieu_2018.
While scholars have advocated for these two approaches, their overly eager application fails to capture the novelty and facets of the PMF. While primordialism has largely fallen by the wayside as of late, ethno-symbolism and its child, sectarianism, largely reigns supreme within the analysis footcite:dodge_bourdieu_2018. Scholars such as Fanar Haddad have advocated for this reading, other scholars such as Toby Dodge or Sara Pursley have shown that, within Iraqi history, the current levels of division along ethno-symbolic lines is an aberration.
Currently, the Iraqi state is undergoing a phase of disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration (DDR). International organizations and the United States have attempted to help the Iraqi government in this process, yet many challenges continue to appear. While the struggles faced by the Iraqi government in its reintegration of the PMF may appear to be caused by poor execution or inadequate funding, it is the overly rigid framework of DDR and the enduring belief in sectarian identities that hamper an effective DDR process.
This paper is divided into three sections: first, a brief history of DDR and its issues will be provided. Second, an assessment of the PMF and the current state of reintegration will be discussed. Last, the paper identifies a few lessons and pitfalls that can be drawn from DDR approaches in other states.
Mosaic DDR Disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration (DDR), alongside security sector reform, are two components of security infrastructure sphere in post-conflict statebuilding, and continues to remain the default template to understand challenges of armed conflicts footcite:munive_rethinking_2015. Multiple other spheres exist, such as political infrastructure, social infrastructure, dealing with legacies of conflict, establishing the rule of law, and setting up for development. As the PMF began within the security sphere and are now transitioning into the political one, reintegration of ex-combatants and reform of the Iraqi Security Forces are paramount. Reintegration is often perceived to be the hardest part of DDR.
The UN integrated standards for DDR footcite:united_nations_level_2006 define reintegration as:
Reintegration is the process by which ex-combatants acquire civilian status and gain sustainable employment and income. Reintegration is essentially a social and economic process with an open timeframe, primarily taking place in communities at the local level. It is part of the general development of a country and a national responsibility, and often necessitates long-term external assistance.
DDR originated as part of the need to reintegrate ex-combatants following peace accords within Africa. Driven by the UN, this was the first generation of DDR, which aimed to reduce violence and followed rigid processes of disarming, demobilizing, and then reintegrating members back into society footcite:iffat_idris_lessons_2016
Due to changing agendas for peace and security, the UN developed the integrated DDR standards in 2006 footcite:united_nations_disarmament_2006, which created &ldquo;second generation&rdquo; DDR. This version of DDR was more human security focused, incorporating concerns about women and children, development, and abandoning the sequential stages of disarming, demobilizing, and reintegrating, allowing reintegration to occur before or in conjunction with other steps footcite:iffat_idris_lessons_2016.
In 2015, a new approach to DDR was defined, aimed at responding to the lackluster reintegration programs that arose out of the first two generations of DDR. Dubbed &ldquo;next generation DDR&rdquo;, this version of DDR took a more forceful approach, including authorizing the use of state authorities to disarm militias. This version of DDR began to take into account how formal peace accords no longer were the default, as well as the rise of armed non-state actors (ANSAs) footcite:munive_rethinking_2015.
As DDR programs have expanded to incorporate conflicts that are still ongoing, DDR programs and counter-insurgency programs1 have begun to align in goals. Both DDR and counter-insurgency are aimed at attacking militarized problems on a political level. While counter-insurgency is largely thought of a military affair, DDR can be thought of as its civilian successor.
However, many counter-insurgency programs have failed to achieve their goals, and it is important for DDR to take lessons from these failures. To begin, counter-insurgency is not a substitute for strategy, and those who emphasize it as such prioritize method over objective . Counter-insurgency is an operational approach, a method to organize actions towards a single strategy, but not the strategy itself. Strategy here is defined as the connective tissue between policy objectives and operational approach, and is responsible for adjusting both. Goals that are not readjusted with realities on the ground have led to ineffective counter-insurgency programs . Therefore, when policy goals set direction, DDR programs must be able to readjust policy goals as new information comes in. Like counter-insurgency, there must be an &rsquo;emphasis on the importance of assessment, continuous assessment and reassessment&rsquo; .
An over-reliance on pattern matching across historical lessons results in a stilted reintegration process. Conflicts are not a series of equations to solve, there is no methodological approach that yields a set of solutions that has a deterministic effect on peacebuilding. While historical peace accords have largely provided a set of similar circumstances for DDR practitioners to base their methods, this has largely broken down with the proliferation of armed groups. In order to rebuild a set of new DDR approaches, conflict and war must be first understood.
Conflict and war are not apolitical events removed from politics, Clauswitz calls &lsquo;War is merely the continuation of policy by other means&rsquo;. War gives meaning to the use of force, and provides an unified interpretive template for the understanding of violence . When Clauswitz conceptualized war, it was as an interstate, polarized affair: two nations (or two groups of nations), an attacker and defender, where war has a victor. War&rsquo;s ultimate goal had two audiences: the members of each nation or group of nations, and the victor sought to impose a narrative upon the defeated through force, guided in the framework of war . This framework for understanding war breaks down with the proliferation of armed groups. For armed groups, there are a variety of audiences, each seeking to impose their own narrative. In Clauswitizian war, &lsquo;winning&rsquo; and &rsquo;losing&rsquo; are ultimately understood by all audiences with the same set of rules, for contemporary warfare, one group&rsquo;s definition of &lsquo;winning&rsquo; may simply be survival, whereas another audience&rsquo;s definition may entail complete destruction of the enemy. This pattern is replicated across both Iraq and Afghanistan, leading military actors to dub these two conflicts &lsquo;mosaic wars&rsquo; footcite:crane_observations_2014, hinting at the set of complex actors that only fractilze when studied from afar.
DDR programs in Iraq must take into account the mosaic features and adjust their goals, including abandoning the concept of a singular ANSA. There is no unifying frame for armed actors within Iraq. DDR within Iraq must be viewed as a political process, and no amount of legal degrees or externally-funded projects will change that. The continuation of conflicts against IS, combined with the lack of an overarching DDR process for the PMF, set against the backdrop of PMF commanders swapping their combat fatigues for suits only serves to illustrate the futility in attempting to find a single cogent DDR method2. In other words, &ldquo;Mosaic wars require a mosaic peace, which can also vary significantly in character from village to village and region to region.&rdquo; footcite:crane_observations_2014
PMF: Sectarian or Not? After the proclamation of the defeat of IS, the position of the PMF has been widely debated. The group has been painted with a kaleidoscope of labels, with the US terming certain groups as &ldquo;Shii&rsquo;te military groups&rdquo; footcite:crispin_smith_its_2020. However, laws demanding the reintegration of the PMF has largely continued to treat them a singular, unitary group, an unhelpful framing that hampers the reintegration process.
In 2016, the Iraqi Parliament passed Law Number 40: The Law of the Hashd al-Shaabi Committee, formally bringing the Hashd al-Shaabi under the auspices of the military chain of command via an organization known as the Popular Mobilization Committee footcite:crispin_smith_its_2020. A series of executive degrees have followed, with one in 2018 that entitled the PMF to the same compensation as other ministries, and another in 2019 that called for the formal PMF integration into the state apparatus footcite:smith_servants_2019. While these laws may look similar to peace accords and may attract reintegration programs to look at historical comparisons to reintegration programs with peace accords, these laws are not. Notably, the PMF law of 2016 passed with only a slim majority footcite:crispin_smith_its_2020, and executive degrees are not negotiated at all.
The most common label for the PMF is &ldquo;Shi&rsquo;a militias&rdquo;, owing to the famous fatwa issued by Ayatollah Sistani. Not only does this label ignore specific PMF groups formed around minorities such as at the Yazidi, the Shabak, and the Turkmen, this label unhelpfully imparts a polarized narrative of war, evoking the idea that IS was somehow a &ldquo;Sunni affair&rdquo; and the idea that the PMF, as a &ldquo;Shi&rsquo;a militias&rdquo; rose up to fight against it. Even before the formation of IS proper and its declaration of a caliphate, al-Qaeda in Iraq, the precursor to IS, was never a purely &ldquo;Sunni&rdquo; franchise. The Sahwa uprisings in 20063, when largely Sunni tribes in Anbar rose up against al-Qaeda showed that there Sunni is not a singular, coherent identity.
To complicate the matter further, the historical understanding of the &ldquo;Sunni&rdquo; or &ldquo;Sunnism&rdquo; identity has always been difficult to untangle in Iraq. Saddam embraced key Sunni points in the early 1990&rsquo;s to shore up support, but political parties such as the Iraqi Islamic Party recognized the dangers in binding together the state and Sunnism footcite:rayburn_iraq_2014. The Iraqi Islamic Party also worked with the Dawa4 and the Muslim Brotherhood to form resistance groups against Saddam in 1979-1980&rsquo;s. Historically, in Iraq, these religious identities were able to cooperate even under the duress of the Saddam state. In attempting to see IS as a pure Sunni affair threatens to subsume the complexities of the various groups that can be broadly grouped under a Sunni identity. While talking about the Sunni identity is a useful label for anthropological matters, warfare takes on a different dimension. The insurgency whether it was various jihadi groups against the Iraqi state or IS against the Iraqi state was a form of civil war. And a proper understanding of civil wars shows that actions in civil war are not necessarily political and do not always reflect a deep ideological polarization, rather civil wars converge the local motives and supralocal ones, privatizing politics and transforming local and personal grievances into violence . While the participants in IS and its precursor groups may have been majority Sunni, this does not imply a deep commitment to Sunnism to the insurgency.
Even the Shi&rsquo;i are not aligned within the PMF. On April 22nd, 2020, the 2nd, 11th, 26th, and 44th brigades5 formally exited the parallel PMF command structure, and moved directly to the &ldquo;command and management&rdquo; of the Iraqi Prime Minister. These four brigades were largely seen as loyal to Ayatollah Sistani, and differing from the brigades controlled by Kata&rsquo;ib Hezbollah, which are seen to be aligned with Iran. Not only is this split within the intra-Shi&rsquo;i community emblematic of the uselessness of the &ldquo;Shia&rdquo; label on the PMF, the split resulting in organizational changes for the command and control structures opens up channels for dialogue within the reintegration process.
These conditions lead to an uncomfortable set of facts: laws that address the PMF as a unitary actor fail to account for differences within the PMF, but attempts at circumscribing individual brigades under sectarianism are still not granular enough. In many cases, dealing with the PMF will require engagement beyond treating the PMF groups as actors in a religious, ethnic, and local sectarian game.
Future of DDR within Iraq Third generation DDR requires a deep continuing strategic dialogue between the international organizations (IOs), the state, and the local population. A few lessons can be drawn from historical comparisons. First, IOs and states cannot drive reintegration top-down, focusing on a comprehensive peace accord or power sharing agreement risks further instability. Lessons learned from Lebanon show this to be the case, where Hezbollah, although a marginal party in the Taif Agreement, has managed to use Taif as a point of legimtization. Before 2006, Hezbollah claimed the informal non-state representation of Lebanese Shiites, while the Amal party claimed their share in government footcite:mohanad_hage_ali_hezbollah_2019, with Hezbollah&rsquo;s raison d&rsquo;etre being the claim that the Lebanese state was too weak to manage its military affairs alone footcite:mohanad_hage_ali_hezbollah_2019
Yet paradoxically, as Hezbollah filled in the gaps of the Lebanese government by expanding to offer social services and media channels, Hezbollah has gone from propping up the Lebanese state to preventing the state&rsquo;s re-emergence. Following the 2006 elections and Hezbollah&rsquo;s formal entrance into government, Hezbollah&rsquo;s focus on maintaining its weapons actively works against the institutions of the Lebanese state. By breaking the state&rsquo;s monopoly on violence and draining state resources for itself, Hezbollah has created a feedback loop where the starvation of the Lebanese state only further entrenches Hezbollah&rsquo;s legitimacy.
Some similarities to Hezbollah have already been seen in Iraq. Kata&rsquo;ib Hezbollah (KH), a PMF group that operates at least four different brigades and has influences over several others, has largely monopolized the Syrian-Iraqi border footcite:akdedian_state_2020 and continue to grow in influence as a result footcite:hamdi_malik_still-growing_2020. Successive laws passed by the Iraqi government to regulate the PMF have failed to curb KH&rsquo;s influence and activities footcite:andrea_plebani_janus_2019. Like how the Clauswitzian model is inappropriate for modern conflict, peace accords and laws to regulate the PMF attempt to circumscribe a myriad of actors that, by nature, cannot be effectively regulated. Buy in from the Iraqi state and IOs are a necessary but not sufficient precursor to reintegration of the PMF.
This is not to say that the Hezbollah model is anywhere close to being replicated. Hezbollah has defined a unique set of models for governance based on a specific set of features only to be found within Lebanon. Short of party names, the specific brigades within the PMF have yet to achieve the necessary foundation to reproduce the Hezbollah model in place. However, with various PMF brigades starting to offer social services in response to covid-19 footcite:jessica_watkins_iraqs_2020, the broad contours have begun to take shape.
Second, political problems must be tackled in concert with economic ones in Iraq. IOs typically fund vocational training, job searching, and other related activities under the assumption that these activities reduce violence6, while there has been no empirical evidence to support this oft-made assertion. Studies in Afghanistan footcite:kapstein_aid_2017, Philippines, and Iraq footcite:berman_working_2009 show little correlation between economic development and reduction of violence. Furthermore, focusing on pure economic development falls into the trap of assuming all actors are rational ones, and will simply pick the most economically beneficial choice. Iraq is still a country at civil war, and civil war has a particular way of endowing violence with &lsquo;a political meaning that reshapes into new and enduring identities&rsquo; . Identities are at the root of these grievances and are political in nature, and therefore can only be addressed through change in civil society7. Analysis that begins with a sectarian frame fails to account for actors within Iraq that have multiple identities at any one time, and none of them are dominant.
Finally, reintegration is long and difficult to fund, but all actors must understand it is a long term project. To use an analogy, an investor seeking long term gains does not expect decisive short term returns. While funding for reintegration has almost always been the most difficult part of DDR footcite:united_nations_level_2006 due to changing long term goals, hopes for reintegration within Iraq must have consistent funding. Projects such as the National Solidarity Program in Afghanistan may provide a useful template for this footcite:beath_national_2015, as the National Solidarity Program was a large scale, long term program that was broken down to into many small projects that focused on realistic improvements on the ground to reduce vulnerability to corruption. These models may provide a useful foundation for programs in Iraq.
The PMF in Iraq will not be easily reintegrated into society, but not because they will act as spoilers to it. Recognizing that the flexibility of the PMF command and control structure endows the Iraqi government with multiple routes towards reintegration while containing the subset of brigades and actors who wish to translate their military power into political ones. Any realistic set of solutions will require a continuing dialogue.

This point requires further elaboration and I could not fit it into 3k words, but the merging of counter-insurgency and DDR goals is a relatively new trend with &ldquo;asymmetric&rdquo; warfare. There is another dimension of counter-insurgency that is state driven vs counter-insurgency that is driven by the US, since the consensus on DDR is that reintegration is best led by the states. Nepal perhaps provides a good case for this, as the election returned a decisive victory for the Communists there. Further research needs to be done on whether there is a comparative case for militias directly entering political parties.&#160;&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;
One of the biggest ideas to sort out is the concept of non-linearity in reintegration and how to deal with it. If the casual arrow between a specific reintegration program and its effect cannot be established in &lsquo;hot&rsquo; conflict zones due to a mess of confounding factors, how does one construct aid? Which projects are funded? How would this be phrased in a way to convince donors?&#160;&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;
There is perhaps another dimension of foreign involvement here. The Sahwa uprisings were seen as a successful &ldquo;counter-insurgency&rdquo;, as they did not require the intervention of US troops, but local tribes cooperated with the US. I am curious if there is a similar line to be drawn to the comparison with the Dhofar campaign, which truly only became successful once the British pulled out of ground troops in Yemen.&#160;&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;
Now largely known as the party of Nouri al-Maliki, the history of the Dawa must be taken into account when looking at &ldquo;cross-sectarian&rdquo; lines.&#160;&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;
The names of the various bridges change quite quickly, whereas the numberings are much more stable.&#160;&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;
cite:munive_rethinking_2015 describe how gang violence may be a potentially good place to start for accounting for violence. Alongside Travis Hirschi’s social control theory, additional research will need to be done to see what reintegration programs look like in post-conflict states when trying to take these lessons into account. It&rsquo;s possible that Bosnia may be a good case to consider, given the myriad of groups operating there. This will require further research.&#160;&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;
It is possible (if not likely) that there is significant path dependency to reintegration via civil society. Civil society can take on many forms that are hard to dislodge once an equilibrium state is reached, and it would be very important to understand the hysteresis loop here.&#160;&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;

Book: Gambetta, Diego, and Heather Hamill. Streetwise: How Taxi Drivers Establish Customer’s Trustworthiness, 2005
Taxi drivers pre-ridesharing days had a pretty wild list of signs to watch. Among these, a driver looked at:
Age (older vs younger) Gender (women vs men) Race (&ldquo;white&rdquo; vs &ldquo;black&rdquo;) Spanish over other ethnic groups (if the driver was Spanish) Group size (individual vs multiple groups) Wealth (wealthier vs poorer) Known passengers over strangers Callers over hailers Catholic over Protestant if the driver is Catholic Self-absorbed over inquisitive Candid over shifty Friendly and calm over aggressive/agitated All of these are captured in Diego Gambetta and Heather Hamill&rsquo;s book Streetwise: How Taxi Drivers Establish Customer Trustworthniess. The book highlights differences between taxi drivers in Belfast and New York. Belfast, being a battleground during the troubles, is largely split into a &ldquo;Protestant&rdquo; and &ldquo;Catholic&rdquo; zones. As a result, Protestant taxi drivers are less willing to travel to Catholic zones, and visa versa. More interestingly is that Protestant drivers will often not even pick up customers that look like they&rsquo;re Catholic, to avoid confrontation.
Belfast taxi drivers also demonstrate a hawkish view towards potential assailants. As a solid minority of the current taxi drivers were involved in armed groups at some point in the past and continue to hold strong ties to their communities, attempting to assult or rob a taxi driver in Belfast has the potential to lead to retribution down the line.
New York taxi drivers, on the other hand, are largely &ldquo;fish out of the water&rdquo;. New York taxi drivers do not have strong ties to the communities they drive in, sometimes don&rsquo;t even speak English, which causes them to adopt a far more dovish tone of deescalation when confronted. Often times the taxi driver is far more willing to simply hand the money over.
The book also details various techniques that taxi drivers use once a passenger is in the car. Specifically, New York taxi drivers preferred not to have the customer sitting right behind them, as that obscures their view. Customers that take an active interest in how much the taxi driver is making, alongside being simply shifty, are also immediately considered to be suspicious by the taxi driver. New York taxi drivers have multiple ways of bailing out of trouble, from panic buttons to hidden lights, to even ramming a police car in the street to attract attention.
Overall, streetwise is an interesting book that attempts to model human trust via game theory of maximizing revenue potential while minimizing customer risk. I&rsquo;d like to see more on this topic, especially ones that cover different taxi cultures. In the Middle East, for example, male customers have an expectation of sitting in the front (since taxi drivers are overwhelmingly male). Does that provide different cues? I&rsquo;d also like to see how this has adopted in the ridesharing world, all of these criteria have effectively been reduced into a single &ldquo;rating&rdquo;.

Takeaway: financial advice is generalized because finance is a weird field, software has much more acute learning signals. Finance models are generically not generalizable, no one would apply black-scholes towards their groceries.
Advice should be taken on how easily something can be abstracted or whether the problem is domain specific. Some patterns applied in firmware and SDR cannot be applied to higher level programming, for example.

[Transformers|Deep Neural Networks|AI] need to be explainable is a common enough refrain. I would say it&rsquo;s a fairly uncontroversial statement that NLP is a field heavy on the experimental and light on the theoretical. With that in mind, I want to talk about the concept of &ldquo;information plane&rdquo;, a term coined by Schwartz-Ziv and Tishby (2017). For Schwartz-Ziv and Tishby, the information plane is &ldquo;the plane of the Mutual Information values that each layer preserves on the input and output variables&rdquo;. I think this can effectively been seen as a proxy for the learning curve or loss landscape, although &ldquo;information plane&rdquo; captures that trajectories within the information plane have two distinct phases Saxe et al (2019):
an initial &ldquo;fitting&rdquo; phase where the mutal information grows a secondary &ldquo;compression&rdquo; phase where the mutal information decreases To make this a little more concrete, I think you can see this as a learning curve analogy, where at first the neural network is attempting to memorize all the data until it runs out of space, and then a compression phase begins, where the softmaxes start to become hardmaxes. Now Saxe et al (2019) state that while it&rsquo;s been hypothesized that this compression phase is responsible for generalization properties, they also point out that not all neural networks exhibit compression dynamics. Double saturating networks, such as those that use tanh or sigmoid, do exhibit compression, whereas ReLUs do not. In addition, randomess during the training process does not seem to affect compression, which brings us to a potentially murky territory: could a network learn without compression?
Saxe et al have this diagram in their paper:
What&rsquo;s interesting here is that you can see tanh networks make a beeline for compression towards later epochs, but the ReLUs do not, which means that information must be preserved somehow within the ReLUs. The question then becomes: was the information complexity of the input dataset not high enough to exhibit compression, or do ReLUs simply never exhibit compression and therefore are unable to learn certain types of input?
If we step back to the statistical idea of minimum sufficiency (a statistic is minimially sufficient where you can maintain the accuracy of predictions, basically a lossless compression of prediction power), we can make some inferences towards what&rsquo;s called the &ldquo;information bottleneck&rdquo; in Tishby et al (1999). What Tishby et al (1999) tells us is that there is a minimum bound on how much information you can compress before you begin to lose prediction accuracy. Looking at it from that perspective, the information plane is actually just where a neural network searches for the information bottleneck!

https://www.instapaper.com/read/1278350355 Claims that there are two insurgencies:
interconnected criminal insurgencies where the global disenfranchised resist, co-opt, and route around states Cartels, traffickers, hackers, arms dealers, etc Plutocratic insurgency, global elites seek to disengage from traditional national obligations and responsbilities Libertarians, tax havens, currency speculators Neither insurgency wishes to seek the control over the state, nor destroy it. They both rely on the state to provide social welfare, but carve out zones of autonomy (like sez&rsquo;s) to make profits.
Post cold war development saw states give up the ghost of creating egalitarian societies and choose to legitimate themselves by claiming to maximize individual opportuinity (generic neoliberal reforms seen by much of the arab states, Hinnebusch - Identity and State Formation in Multi‐sectarian Societies)
Fukuyama&rsquo;s &ldquo;The End of History&rdquo; and Williamson&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Washington Consensus&rdquo; made it explicit.
Moreover, the two signature types of massive wealth accumulation in the early 21st century have been high technology and financial services. Neither of these industries relies on masses of laborers, so their productivity is detached from the health of any particular national middle class.
Criminals &ldquo;Deviant&rdquo; globalization in narcotics, immigration, wildlife harvesting, and antiquities smuggling remained long enough in the shadows for it to set deep roots.
The unsung globalizers of the 1990s and 2000s, therefore, were the criminals who rapidly scaled up their local mom-and-pop graft organizations to become globe-spanning deviant commercial empires. Weak states allow crinimals to carve out zones where they can thrive, but the state still supports social services (a la Mexico).
Plutocrats Plutocrats want to defang the state, but to facilitate private-sector looting, instead of public sector looting like kleptocrats (although many times these co-mingle, again in the case of syria)

http://matt.might.net/articles/advice-for-phd-thesis-proposals/ https://sarahendren.com/2020/11/16/thesis-advice/ Thesis Proposal Summary The Shia Husseiniyya rituals are a widely studied topic within Islam studies, but the specifics of the rituals have largely focused on Syria or Iran. While there is significant literature on the passion plays (ta&rsquo;ziyeh) of Iran, there is nearly no work about two specific aspects of the rituals: the liturgical orators known as radoods, and the processional chants known as radat.
These two aspects of Husseiniyya rituals are unique because of their banality and, unlike other aspects such as ritualized head cutting (tatbir), there are few written controversies about it. The lack of written work hides their importance: both are oral traditions conducted in the local vernacular that allow the Karbalaeis to think of themselves in a new light. In other words, my thesis is: The husseiniyya rituals conducted by the people of Karbala create a permanent state of pilgrimage, allowing the people of Karbala to straddle the political and the religious.
The implication is that these rituals provide a new place to understand political resistance and conceptualization of the self. Through the usage of the vernacular in rituals, the Karbalaeis can bridge aspects of nationalism, political inclusion, and piety.
This work allows for a deeper understanding of Shi&rsquo;a identity within Iraq, which is often drowned in the acid vat of sectarianism discussions. I plan on writing against sectarian dialogues that misrepresent the Shia laity as automatons. I also want to push the idea of pilgrimage as a mode of being that takes people out of their traditional environments to this idea that there are people who consistently live in what we would consider a pilgrimage environment. Furthermore, this research attempts to be the first English work that records the institutions that organize rituals within Karbala for Karbalaeis.
IRB is not required for this project, as the research is conducted about the rituals and institutions, not about the specific individuals per 45 CFR 46.102.
Survey of Related Work To the best of my knowledge, the only English word that references radoods is a master&rsquo;s thesis written by Faraj Hattab Hamdan. Hamdan only briefly references the radoods in their act but did not conduct interviews with radoods or attempt to peak into their history. I have not been able to find English work about radat at all, and only scant references in the Arabic literature.
Previous books that reconceptualize pilgrimage as a permanent state are Pilgrims Until we Die, and books about Taz&rsquo;yeh. The methods from Pilgrims until we die are useful, and I plan on conducting interviews in similar fashions. However, they do not discuss the history of institutions and neighborhoods, which is one thing I plan on writing about.
Additional work has been done by Edith Szanto about the Shia rituals in Damascus, and other prior work has been conducted on Shia rituals in general. However, all these studies have been conducted in situations outside of Iraq, and are focused on different shrines.
There exists significant Arabic literature on Husseiniyya rituals and the history of Karbala, which I plan on tapping into as needed. I have yet to conduct a thorough Arabic literature review, and it is possibly outside the scope of a master&rsquo;s thesis.
Summary of Prior Completed Work Previous fieldwork in Karbala has already been conducted between August 17-20, 2021, March 19-30th, 2022, and July 3rd to September 14th, 2022. At these times, I visited the shrines nearly every day during the daytime and nighttime and often slept at the shrine, while chatting with pilgrims and the members of the shrine or the &lsquo;ulema. Additional fieldwork outside of these dates was conducted in Najaf at the Shrine of Imam Ali and Wadi Salaam and in Kathimiya at the Shrine of Imam al-Kathim. Furthermore, I walked the pilgrimage from Najaf to Karbala between September 11th and September 14th, conducting interviews with pilgrims who largely hailed from Iran.
The bulk of the reading has already been completed, and interviews have already been conducted with radoods, religious elders, institutional representatives, and Karbala residents.
I have an archive of photographs, videos, and recordings of rituals in addition to recorded interviews. These archives have been largely translated by me, with the translations being validated by Iraqi roommates. I believe that the fieldwork has been completed, and the only remaining work is to write, edit, and fact-check the thesis itself.
Remaining Research Challenges I believe that a few remaining challenges exist for this research, as the fieldwork is primarily completed. Given that I am currently maintaining residencies in Karbala, Baghdad, and Erbil, I also believe that any further fieldwork required will be relatively easy to conduct. The remaining research challenges is translating the Arabic literature, which is a project that will outlast the duration of the thesis.

Timekeeping devices have trans­formed civiliza­tions more than once. As Lewis Mumford pointed out in 1934: “The clock, not the steam-engine, is the key-machine of the modern indus­trial age.” graves of tarim, the merchant class of Hadramis and Chinese gain power by using cultural arbitrage: their consistent set of practices and mutual respect cushioned the different economic systems

Time as the Ur-text of Behavior: Pilgrimage, Distributed Systems, and Money Time is money, money is time. Anthropologists love talking about time, especially our conceptualizations of it. I study Karbala, a Shia holy city, and the entirety of pilgrimage revolves around a new conceptualization of time. Academics debate how time relates to pilgrimage, and Shia rituals, through the medium of tragedy, reenact the Battle of Karbala in 680 AD. Funnily enough, the other side of me works heavily in distributed systems and money, which is yet another part of the world that deals heavily with time.
In fact, all three systems (pilgrimage, distributed systems, and money) are all premised around two entwined concepts: time and consistency. I&rsquo;m going to make the argument that because time and consistency are so interrelated, we can use the tools provided by distributed systems research and monetary behavioral research to read into pilgrimage. Consistency is created through labor acting upon time, but creation of consistency requires creating a man-made informational realm, which in turn informs social behavior. This obviously requires a few leaps of faith, so let&rsquo;s build from the beginning: tokens and ordering.
Tokens Tokens are physical things we define that can be exchanged for value. A dollar bill, a gold doubloon, a shiny rock, etc, let&rsquo;s define to be tokens. Tokens, by virtue of existing in the physical world, cannot be replicated without some effort: you need to dig up a new doubloon, print a new bill, which limits their reach. Once exchanged, you cannot simply cause a new token to appear into existence. If you spend a shiny rock, new shiny rocks do not magically appear in your pocket: you need to go perform some amount of labor (digging up new shiny rocks) to acquire another token. However, at a certain point, tokens become cumbersome due to their physical nature: you can&rsquo;t walk around with 10,000 shiny rocks all the time. As a result, ledgers become necessary.
Ledgers, however, exist purely in the informational realm. Ledgers record how much of specific tokens one possesses. The difference being ledgers and tokens that you can simply make up money on a ledger, or add more zeros, in the case of central bank printing money. This man-made informational realm is subject to manipulation: we all are aware of the Enron accounting scandals, bank fraud, and all sorts of similar problems. In the monetary system, central banks solve this with centralization: there is one large ledger that tracks a monetary system1.
Consistency But what is centralization actually doing? Centralization is simply the labor of creating consistency. Consistency matters in money because it lies at the heart of the double spend problem: if everyone could print fake bills, we&rsquo;d end up with massive inflation. For online purchases, it would be massively problematic if you could go to two merchants and spend the same 10 dollars.
Consistency has implications for social as well. Hadrami merchants, who departed from Hadramout in Yemen to build a merchant empire across the Indian ocean, built it because they were able to bypass the diverse set of social customs and laws across the ocean. They did this through geneaology, or the assurance that a familial tie, built upon time, could provide a stable foundation for trade across disparate sytems. Ensung Ho writes2:
Those genealogies have two important dimensions: while they enable the tracing of origins, they also allow communities of diverse origins to articulate with each other in new relations of mutuality and moral engagement, such as in shared family and shared religion. This duality involves cohabitation of closed and open aspects, or, in the more specific terms of kinship, of patrilineal and matrilateral ties.
Time and labor produces geneology. The Hadrami merchants were helped along by their specific social customs of marriage: male descendants of the prophet were only allowed to marry other descendants of the prophet. In this practice, Hadrami merchants transformed time into a literal monetary value and built an empire. The Hadramis are not unique in this, the modern Bamboo network is a similar system. In fact this was observed far earlier by Harold Ingrams, who states3:
It appears, in the East, that when you do not have Jews you have Hadhramis or Chinese and all are alike in their exclusiveness.
This &ldquo;exclusiveness&rdquo; is just the opposite view of consistency. What is exclusive for the outgroup is consistent for the ingroup, and all three mercantile groups have parlayed their consistency into money. In other words, geneology is just a specific type of cultural consistency, and time and a specific cultural labor produces geneology, which in turn creates a sort of &ldquo;cultural capital&rdquo; that can be loosely liquidated into actual money later. Concepts of wasta4 and guanxi5 follow this.
History 1, History 2, and Distributed Systems In the case of geneology, we&rsquo;ve only discussed a single time: human time. However, the concept of labor applied onto time is hardly new: Dipesh Chakrabaty talks about History 1 and History 26, where the conception of historical time as an empty, godless, and uniform hamstrings the way Indians and third world historians write about their own history. Geologic time runs on a different time scale than humans and railway time functions to align industry, and not everything must stem from a singular conceptualization of time, as Chakrabaty tells us.
Yet we hardly need to reach into post-colonial studies for various conceptualizations of time: Leslie Lamport has already done that for us in his seminal paper Time, Clocks, and the Ordering of Events in a Distributed System. As Lamport tells us:
The concept of time is fundamental to our way of thinking. It is derived from the more basic concept of the order in which events occur. We say that something happened at 3:15 if it occurred after our clock read 3:15 and before it read 3:16. The concept of the temporal ordering of events pervades our thinking about systems. For example, in an airline reservation system we specify that a request for a reservation should be granted if it is made before the flight is filled. However, we will see that this concept must be carefully reexamined when considering events in a distributed system.
A distributed system consists of a collection of distinct processes which are spatially separated, and which communicate with one another by exchanging messages. A network of interconnected computers, such as the ARPA net, is a distributed system. A single computer can also be viewed as a distributed system in which the central control unit, the memory units, and the input-output channels are separate processes. A system is distributed if the message transmission delay is not negligible compared to the time between events in a single process.
&hellip;
In a distributed system, it is sometimes impossible to say that one of two events occurred first. The relation &ldquo;happened before&rdquo; is therefore only a partial ordering of the events in the system. We have found that problems often arise because people are not fully aware of this fact and its implications.
What are the conditions that Lamport refers to? It is the idea of casual ordering, the idea that we need to define specific events happening before another. Specifically:
If an event \\(A\\) happens before event \\(B\\) within the same process, we say \\(A \\rightarrow B\\) If a process \\(i\\) sends a message at \\(A\\) to process \\(j\\), and process \\(j\\) acknowledges this process at \\(B\\), then we can say \\(A \\rightarrow B\\). \\(\\rightarrow\\) is a transative operator, if \\(A \\rightarrow B\\) and \\(B \\rightarrow C\\), then \\(A \\rightarrow C\\) Two events \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are described as concurrent if neither \\(A\\) has happened before \\(B\\) and \\(B\\) hasn&rsquo;t occured before \\(A\\). This happens from the perspective of a process if the two events are not casual, i.e. they do not have an effect on each other. This means that each independent process cannot establish an authoritative order on the system, they can only establish a partial ordering. Lamport makes this more clear with a diagram:
In the diagram above, process \\(P, Q, R\\) are sending messages to each other. Verticle bars represent each process, wavy lines represent messages that have effects. A dot is a single event. Time goes bottom up. In this diagram \\(p1 \\rightarrow p2\\) in process \\(P\\), and \\(q1 \\rightarrow p2\\) in process \\(Q\\). However, looking at this globally, we can see that \\(q3\\) is supposed to happen before \\(p3\\), but because the events have no casual relationship, it is impossible from the perspective of either process \\(P\\) or \\(Q\\) to establish a complete order, and we must say these events are concurrent. While we can say \\(q3 \\rightarrow p4\\) because \\(q3 \\rightarrow q5\\) and $q5 → \\(q4\\) from the perspective of process \\(Q\\). In other words, each process only has a partial view on the ordering of events.
How do we solve this problem? The obvious solution is the one that&rsquo;s on the page: establish a clock that everyone follows, and set a standard for everyone to follow. This is exactly what happened with railroads, which spurred the invention of time zones. In fact, Lamports entire example of processess \\(P, Q, R\\) can be thought of as different railway stations. Imagine process \\(P\\) is Philadephila, process \\(Q\\) is Chicago, and process \\(R\\) is San Francisco. The arrows become trains that must arrive. \\(p1\\) is the train leaving Philadephia to Chicago, which must leave as the same time as \\(p2\\), the train from Chicago to Philadephia. Since going forwards and back takes the same amount of time, but Chicago is offset from Philadephia geographically, we must add an one hour offset in order to account for this.
The creation of timezones is the creation of consistency, which requires continious labor to upkeep: leap seconds and time zone offsets create endless problems for programmers: Facebook would rather remove leap seconds than fix the engineering challenges and programmers commit endless issues with time in their code. This labor is largely invisible because it&rsquo;s settled in as self evident, but its creation was only due to the fact that railways provided a faster way to travel, forcing us to reconceptualize what could be done in a day. Labor as yet again been performed upon time to standarize it.
Pilgrimage Back to pilgrimage. The pilgrimage of the Hadramis back to Hadramout served as a cultural anchor and a constant reminder of geoneology: &ldquo;Indonesians who embark on pilgrimage to Ḥaḍramawt expect to experience an idealized Islamic past&rdquo;7 Chinese New Year, the world&rsquo;s largest migration of human beings, serves a similar role in the upkeep of the social network. Chinese conceptualizations of Huaxia function in much the same way, rooting a specific notion of Chinese-ness to a greater geonology. However, traditions are not free, they require massive labor to perform. Chinese New Year brings labor-intensive processess of infrastructure upkeep and strains railway systems, flights, and roads.
The pilgrimage of Karbala, which I study, is the surest sign of this. Every year, millions of pilgrims descent upon Karbala, requiring water, food, and lodging. Much of this is performed by mowkebs, tents which provide services for pilgrims for free. Mowkebs collect donations throughout the year to pay for the services, and in so doing perform the labor of upkeeping religious tradition.
Pilgrims collecting water and food from a mowkeb. Photo by me, August 1st, 2022.
Pilgrimage serves to anchor pilgrims into a different time. The pigrimage of Karbala uses tragedy and suffering as a medium to draw pilgrims back: the reenactment of the battle, ritualized bloodletting, and self falgetllation all provide this. Pain and sadness act as a physical and emotional avenues on the subject pilgrim.
Money and the Machine Somali shillings are an example of how consistency affects social behavior. Despite the collapse of Somali central bank, shillings continued to be used. We see extreme efforts made to preserve this consistency, such as the Yemeni central bank flying bills back and forth between Sana&rsquo;a and Aden, until the printing of additional notes caused a specific type of inflation for newly printed notes.
This is hardly suprising, everyone is aware of the power of culture and tradition. The point I want to emphasize here is that tradition and genology are subtypes of consistency. Humans are distributed and diverse, and the Church, religion, geneology, history, tradition, etc are all creations of a shared reality, serviced by a mediation of a shared time. While some are centralized (the papacy, central banks), some are distributed (pilgrimage), and some are mixed. The power of money, religion, and social behavior is the creation of a man-made realm, but the act of creating this realm creates a different subject. Time serves as the ur-text of human behavior because it is single thing most people could agree upon the majority of human history, purely because it marches on. Money is a simple abstraction upon time: it is a stored form of time that takes on two shapes, token and ledger forms. Just as money breaches the physical and the information, religious acts do so as well, through physical acts and informational ones. The biggest difference is that the informational realm has different metaphysics and requires different rules, just as centralized and distributed systems must be built differently.

To give an indication of the extent of this knowledge production, I refer briefly to the Development Assistance and Reform Platform (DARP) hosted by the PNA Ministry of Planning and Administrative Development (MOPAD) – a non-comprehensive database of proposed, on-going, completed or suspended donor projects in the OPT. DARP registers an astonishing 1132 projects by more than 93 donor agencies from when the database was established in 2010 (no month available) to August 2014.
The UN, which maintains its own database of projects (the UN Project Information System (UNPRIS)) for the 22 UN bodies active in the OPT, lists 412 projects as ‘underway’ or ‘planned’ as of May 2012. 4 The World Bank, counts 753 project documents, 186 research publications and 99 projects on its OPT website.

iPython traitlets is a multiuse library that can be used for enforcing specific trait attributes. They also can be used to facilitate quite a bit of communication between different ipywidgets, which is something I learned today.
Specifically, let&rsquo;s say you have a plot that takes a dataframe in a matplotlib manner, such as bqplot:
import numpy as np import bqplot.pyplot as plt import pandas as pd x = pd.Series(np.linspace(-10, 10, 100) y = np.sin(x) fig = plt.figure() line = plt.plot(x=x, y=y) fig Now let&rsquo;s say you want to have an UI that:
displays the entire dataframe as a filterable datagrid gives you options on what to plot against automatically updates the plot based on the filters in the datagrid You can do this in shockingly few lines of Python using the ipydatagrid, bqplot, traitlets, and Jupyterwidgets.
Setup the jupyter dropdowns
Setup the datagrid
Setup the hook on the &ldquo;transform&rdquo; in the datagrid
Set the hook to take in the datagrid
Update the plot as needed

Peacekeeping is based on the trinity of consent, neutrality/impartiality and the use of force in self-defence.
Talks about how neutrality has been abandoned, but the impartailty of force should make up for it
Makes a clear distinction between a peacekeeping operation and a coercive peace enforcement action
However, the UN must mediate between actors, and in selecting the actors it inherently legitimizes by making them a party to the negotiations
Notes that UN also must have verticle consent, between some groups on the ground, the state, and everyone in between, but not necessarily all the groups of each category

ideas of universalism foundation -&gt; collective security state based -&gt; chapter 5 vs chapter 7 human security based -&gt; poc, rise of independence combination based -&gt; extension of the state Draft UN peacekeeping operations (PKO) have evolved dramatically over time, with four notable &ldquo;ages&rdquo; of peacebuild cite:diehl_not_2017, with documents such as the Brahimi report cite:blocq_fog_2006 and the HIPPO report cite:gorur_prioritizing_2016 spurring doctrinal changes within the last two decades. Moments such as the massacres in Sarajevo has spurred the UN to adopt new mandates over time, and the variety of environments for PKOs, from gang violence in Haiti to the failed state of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), has brought about new tactics and angles in the discourse around the purpose of peacekeeping. Debates around the protection of civilians, viablility of mandates, and the use of force, set within the stage of the burcractic turf wars of the UN has lead to a fractal of problems. Yet the discourse around peacekeeping operations largely fails to question the underlying logic, the logic of international universialism that the UN espouses. Peacekeeping operations do not exist in a vacuum, and the logic of the UN is to treat &ldquo;the state as the basic unit for the macro scale and presumed backdrop for the individual behavior on the micro scale.&rdquo; cite:li_universal_2020. It is this logic that hampers UN missions from fulfilling their protection of civilians mandates.
In this paper, I turn to understanding PKOs by looking at their problems, rather than their evolution. It is my belief that looking at doctrinal shifts obscures the structural issues, akin to rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic. Instead, I identify three core problems that are common to PKOs: inconsistency on the usage of force, restrictions on funding, and the need for the UN to appear legitimate. Like cell signals, these three problems can be used to triangulate towards the real problem: approaching PKOs from the perspective of states is flawed if a protection of civilian mandate is required.
Diehl and Druckman identify four different stages of peacekeeping: the &ldquo;golden age&rdquo; of the 1956-1978, the &ldquo;lost decade&rdquo; of 1979-1988, the &ldquo;revival&rdquo; of 1989-1990, and finally the post-2000&rsquo;s restructuring cite:diehl_not_2017. Founded as a result of the Arab-Israeli and Indian-Pakistan conflicts, PKOs found it difficult to carry out peacekeeping operations during the Cold War due to a lack of regional organizations to cooperate with, and with the absolute respect towards state soveriegnty cite:diehl_not_2017. PKOs can largely be bucketed into six different types: preventive deployment, traditional peacekeeping, implementation of settlements, humanitarian corridors, replacement of a collapsed state, and ceasefire enforement cite:goulding_evolution_1993. Alongside creating this taxonomy in 1993, Goulding also remarked on the perpetual funding problems of PKOs, the need for a codified rules on the usage of force, and that the greatest tool of the UN was its legitimacy.
Legitimacy lies at the core of the PKOs, the UN secretary general (SG) cannot be seen to be overly cautious, lest they be seen as weak cite:goulding_evolution_1993, but cannot deploy forces to all places, such as any location where the P5 (China, US, France, UK, Russia) are soverign cite:stedman_evaluating_2002. Legimaticy is the greatest strength of international organizations, as legitmacy can be conferred. For example, the UN and confer legitmiacy and set agendas between different actors during a peace accord, determining who gets a seat at the table cite:barnett_international_2018. Libya&rsquo;s freefall into the abyss of civil war has largely been centered around who gets the spoils of the new government, showing that the power to determine agendas is very real.
The UN&rsquo;s legitimacy stems from the &ldquo;International Community&rdquo;, an almost deliberately bland terminology. Grounded by the legal theory that the UN Charter is signed by most countries, the International Community is dominated by the liberal world order cite:barnett_international_2018 but not reducibly so. However, PKOs are projects that may undertake violence to achieve its goals, and the existence of the International Community is to regulate violence. Therefore, it is the Security Council that promulgate mandates for PKOs, ultimately authorizing violence through the burecratic process of the UN. The UN, an organization that &ldquo;is not party to the Geneva Conventions (1949) or the Additional Protocols (1977), or to the International Covenants on Civil and Political Rights, and Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (1966)&rdquo; cite:sheeran_intervention_2014, has its force &ldquo;washed&rdquo; through the system of the UN, even as it is not a formal party to the most commonly accepted terms of violence.
While omission of the UN from these treaties may seem like a flaw, the UN has utilized this &ldquo;feature&rdquo; to claim an impartiality for peacekeepers. Recent peacekeeping operations have moved towards authorization under Chapter VII, which would fall under the &ldquo;peace enforcement&rdquo; in Goulding&rsquo;s taxonomy. This authorizes PKOs to undertake operations where the local state cannot maintain order, such as the DRC, Bosnia, and Haiti cite:de_coning_what_2019. However, the process of authorization of violence is muddled, states retain control of their own armed forces even as they are deployed under the UN banner, leading to complex command chains and procedures, such as the missions in Somalia, where the accepted minimum usage of force lead to catestrophic consequences cite:hunt_all_2017. In the DRC, there is legal ambiguity as to the status of UN brigades. While the UN recongizes that the Intervention Brigade in the DRC is a party to the conflict, the UN also claims that other peacekeepers are impartial, even as the International Committee of the Red Cross sees the entire UN mission as a party to the conflict cite:sheeran_intervention_2014. A further step forwad is the trend towards &ldquo;stabilization&rdquo; missions, PKOs that attempt to enforce state authority. The stabilization missions in Mali and the DRC are two examples of this, where the Mali mission has acquired significant operational capability to conduct counterterrorism and counterinsurgency operations, while the DRC mission is on track to conduct the same types of operations in the future cite:karlsrud_at_2015.
The evolution of the usage of force is not a small change. While earlier peacekeeping missions held state authority with absolute respect, stabilization missions are seen as a extension of state authority. As a result, stabilization missions have been critisized for &ldquo;liddism&rdquo;, or ignoring the root causes of conflict in favor of &ldquo;keeping a lid&rdquo; on violence and instability cite:curran_stabilization_2020. Scholars have critisized the mission in the DRC for collaborating with the national army of the DRC, who have been credibily accused of human rights violations cite:sheeran_intervention_2014. The UN cannot be seen as an legitimate actor when its partners in the host country are commiting human rights violations, and cannot be seen as an coherent independent entity when the rules of engagement differ per brigade, but cannot be distinguished by outsiders. This loss of legitimacy and independence threatens the UN mission itself, and hampers it from carrying out protection of civilian mandates.
Burecratic restrictions on funding also hamper UN missions. Troop funding must be provided by different countries, and often times funding is not provided upfront and only once the mission has started. Relief funding is capped by budgetary processess, which are then focused on short term projects. The IOM noted, in the case of South Sudan, funding is largely for short-term relief projects with the protection of civilian camps, despite heavy evidence pointing towards the opposite cite:iom_if_2016. In multiple reports from 2011 and 2015, the UN has identified problems with unpredictible funding cite:united_nations_future_2015,united_nations_restructuring_2017,united_nations_challenge_2015.
Unpredictable funding means that, even with the best intentions, only short term objectives can be carried out. In general, the lack of consensus in the SC leads to common denominator type mandates, often with unrealistic deadlines and overinflated goals cite:stedman_evaluating_2002. In the case of Haiti, it was identified as decisive military force, at the discretion of the in-country commander with information provided by the Joint Misison Analysis Center embedded within the mission, and the most effective units were Brazilians, who had supplied their own equipment cite:dorn_intelligence-led_2009. In Cote I&rsquo;vore, it is the French, operating under the banner of the the UN mission but supplied and funded by their own country, who has had the most success cite:bovcon_frances_2009. The UN itself has identified the gap between humanitarian response and peacekeeping, humantiarian response has more than 16 billion dollars allocated to it than peacekeeping cite:united_nations_challenge_2015. Moreover, a global color line runes through PKOs, where countries of the global South are largely troop contributing countries, and richer countries contribute funds cite:de_coning_what_2019. The UN&rsquo;s avoidence of engaging in civil wars where the government possess a large army, or any mission inside a member of the P5 cite:stedman_evaluating_2002 leads to a situation where countries of the global south are expected to police themselves and fall into line under the UN banner, whereas western troops, when engaged in PKOs, often have a parallel chain of command, such as in the case of the US and Somalia cite:murphy_united_2003 or France and Cote I&rsquo;voire cite:bovcon_frances_2009. This
Beyond the UN&rsquo;s own inability to raise funds, the strive for legitimacy among the International Community has lead to an overly focused statist approach. Legitimacy, in the form of a &ldquo;successful&rdquo; mission, has lead missions to race towards procedural democracy as a barometer. In El Salvador, even though the most public opinion has considered the mission a success, de Soto and del Castillo have identified that the &ldquo;the proclamation of success is premature&rdquo;. They find that there are significant problems, even though the UN has prodded parties within El Salvador towards a declaration of peace, the on-scheduled elections allowed the UN to retreat under the banner of success cite:de_soto_implementation_1995. The situation is worse in East Timor, where the Timorese have claimed that the UN mission has &ldquo;failed them&rdquo;, with the UN mission claiming a success based on an orderly election in 2001 cite:chopra_building_2002. Even more scholars have identified the difficulties in measuring success cite:gilligan_interventions_2008, as the lack of clear guidelines for mission success leads UN missions towards revising down their goals, such as in the case of East Timor.
It is tempting to think that better measurements of civilian casualties cite:fortna_does_2004, or violence cite:stedman_evaluating_2002 with more limited mandates cite:adamczyk_twenty_2019 can lead to greater success on the protection of civilians. However, the problem is not just one of evaluation. The protection of civilians mandate exists as a result of the international norms, which are problematic when reduced to rules of engagement cite:blocq_fog_2006. In multiple cases, such as the Sudan, it has become clear that UN commanders are hesitant to use force to carry out protection of civilians, and even have difficulties determining who is eligible under the protection of civilians mandate cite:iom_if_2016. The requirement for UN peacekeepers to work through the local government encourages missions to achieve the minimum goals of success for the specific mandates (such as elections), often at cost of unsuccessful mandates (such as the protection of civilians). But the unspecific mandates result from compromises at the SC and the host country, there is no way to write a clear protection of civilians mandate without offending anyone. The UN seeks to claim legitimacy among a group of states, which leads it to chase surface level results, such as procedural democracy of stabilization. The protection of civilian mandate aims to do just that, protect civilians. Civilians are not smaller form of states, and civilians are not directly part of the group the UN gains its legitimacy from. The UN is accountable to states, not civilians, yet expected to protect civilians. This incongruence of goals will always lead to the easiest results.
The unclear rules on the usage of force, structural problems within the UN bureacracy, and a race towards surface level results without addressing the roots of conflict will always prevent the UN from achieveing a protection of civilian mandates. Ultimately, the logic of internationalism, where the UN is accountable to only states and not the groups it polices and protects, is unworkable within the framing of protection of civilians. The global color line that runs through PKOs, where richer countries operate under a separate chain of command and troop countributing countries are asked to fall in line with the UN encourages problems to be evaluated from the state approach. Peacekeepers are ultimately accountable to either their own governments or the UN, neither of which has a stake in the local population. The bureucratic funding problems within the UN arise from its need to raise funds from individual countries. It is no wonder that a complicated buracry begets complicated rules of engagement and usage of force. Peacekeeping is a violent act made legitimate through the normative statements of the SC and the International Community. The fraught debates around usage of force stems from the vagueness of how this violence can be used. As a result, the UN will tend towards conservative intreptations, whereas a true protection of civilians mandate requires a liberal one. As long as the UN approaches civilians as extensions of the state, who can be protected vis-a-vis the state, the UN will never achieve its lofty goals on the protection of civilians.
Newer force missions carry out state based stabilization, even at the cost of protection of civilians Funding cannot allow for protection of civilians in the long term, only short term Race towards procedural democracy is against protection of civilians Since the cold war, &ldquo;international community&rdquo; talk about the formation talk about chapter 5 vs chapter 7 talk about burecratic restrictions on funding talk about legitimacy (mali, drc, east timor, el salvador) race towards procedural democracy talk about how insconsistency of the usage of force means that the UN will not be seen as an &ldquo;independent&rdquo; actor, even if that was possible talk about how the funding inconsistency means that projects will never be long term, and perpetuate the cycle of emergency talk about how the need to leave appearing legitimate, and a rush towards procedural democracy does not facilitate a good state (kabuki theatre). &ldquo;when the UN &ldquo;safe area&rdquo; of Srebrenica in Eastern Bosnia was overrun by Bosnian Serb forces. The bloody and horrific aftermath of Srebrenica&rsquo;s capture, just one year on from the genocide in Rwanda, inevitably and quite understandably influenced the subsequent evolution of UN peacekeeping and the discussion about its purposes. As the spate of new operations since 1999 has shown, the apparent determination to ensure that the horrors of Rwanda and former Yugoslavia would never again be repeated on the UN&rsquo;s watch has emphatically not resolved the deeper tension between ends and means highlighted by the Supplement, tensions which, if anything, have become more acute.&rdquo; (Berdal 2019:117) `}),e.add({id:1664,href:"/posts/un_department_of_peacekeeping_dpko/",title:"un department of peacekeeping (DPKO)",content:`Tags: un

Neoliberalism has this interesting way of making us all the fruit of the poisonous tree through its continual embedding of us as nodes within a massive graph. The condition of our existance is to be moving forward on this scale, blah blah, we&rsquo;ve all heard this one a million times before1, 2, we&rsquo;re all Mark Fisher 3 or working Graberian bullshit jobs4. The Bretton Woods institutions are extractive, foreign aid serves to financialize and create consumers in third world countries while having aid flow back, the continual labor of debt is not an enlightended individualism, but serves to render profitiability from people.
This brand of discourse is lobbied out of humanities graduate students, but I think it lacks a clear view of how the tech industry has also been affected by it. The bulk of startups unicorns within the last decade are finance companies in disugise: Uber/Lyft/Airbnb all serve as market makers that connect a labor pool with a capital pool. Following the era of &ldquo;pure&rdquo; tech companies (Microsoft/Google/etc), we arrived at the age of social media companies (Facebook/Twitter), and then at the age of market makers (Uber/Lyft/Airbnb). Following the mid-2010 era, the rise of pay-it-later companies such as Klarna/Affirm and credit card companies such as Brex have all leveraged the age of cheap money to act as unregulated banks, extending loans to a consumer class that cannot regularly pay.
In the same way the bulk of foreign aid goes to pay for foreign projects staffed by foreign workers while shaping natives into a consumer class, Klarna and Affirm act as pseudo-inner colonization: they perform the labor of creating debt within a group where it was previously unavailable. Foreign aid projects and foriegn investment creates new markets for western products and services by transforming the third world inhabitant into a consumer. Just as how Casper&rsquo;s market was originally only the middle class who could afford to drop 1k on a mattress, the existence of pay-it-later products expands the market into gradually lower class consumers.
Cheap money has far larger second order effects that just the tech boom, cheap money is basically responsible for the rise of fracking within the United States: fracking companies such as Chesapeak have never been profitable, yet investors have happily chucked money into these schemes due to low interest rates 5. VC funding within the lifetime of the majority of tech workers today is basically a continuation of 19th century whaling investments 6. The majority of labor in SEA is contract labor, which provides for aggressive movement of labor across companies. Why did so many tech companies have staff in Ukraine, forcing their hand when the war started? Ukraine&rsquo;s labor laws are far more loose than the rest of Europe, providing near-Europe talent without the high labor costs.
None of these notes are novel, but it still feels like we act as either this is something to be resisted, or something to be ignored. What would happen if we leaned in?

Along the way, observers categorize migrants between two poles: either the migrant as &ldquo;refugee&rdquo; or a migrant as an &ldquo;economic migrant&rdquo;. This dual classification, with significant grey area in between, affords people different rights and treatment along the way. The term &ldquo;refugee&rdquo; has legal standing in some countries and carries certain rights and access to international institutions, but implies a loss of agency. &ldquo;Economic migrant&rdquo; is more hazy, as the term typically implies choice, but does not have a set of understood rights footcite:crawley_refugees_2018. Both of these labels have shown to inaccurately describe current migration flows, yet their usage persists in common discourse. The result is the responsibility of violence is attenuated between the actors encountered by the refugees: destination governments, governments of states in transit, and the initial government that caused the migration. However, I argue that the actors with responsibility for violence against migrants is not any singular state or blocs of states, but rather any actor that engages in segregative biopolitics against migrants. This includes not only actors such as the EU or the United States, but also the UN.
This essay aims to explore the status of al-akharin, or &ldquo;the others&rdquo; in Lebanon as a case study, and its relationship to the refugee-economic migrant continuum. The akharin are composed of three groups: Palestinians, Syrians, and foreign workers. Lebanon hosts a significant population of Palestinian refugees, whose relatively long term of stay has muddled makes it difficult to cleanly classify them on either pole. Syrians, given the relative recency of the conflict, lean more closely to the refugee end, while foreign workers, imported from Nepal, the Philippines, and other countries, lean further towards the economic migrant end. In addition, Lebanon&rsquo;s political system, carefully balanced through sects that require careful management of biopolitics, presents a country that steadfastly refuses long term settlement of any group, whether they be Palestinian, Syrian, or foriegn workers.
Aslı Iğsız describes &ldquo;segregative biopolitics&rdquo; as a force that creates racialized taxonomies footcite:igsiz_humanism_2018. This taxonomy on the international level constitutes what Iğsız terms &ldquo;another terrain of population management&rdquo;, calibrated towards not only the process of migrating in, but also the process of deportation and assimilation. This is most clear on the topic of economic migrants in Lebanon, foreign workers often experience segregation in access to services based on their race .
Emma Haddad describes a refugee as &ldquo;someone that has been forced, to a significant degree, outside of the domestic political community indefinitely&rdquo; footcite:haddad_refugee_2001. This definition is more broad than the definition of refugee that the UN provides, which describes a refugee as someone who is unable or unwilling to return to their country of origin based on fear footcite:refugees_what_nodate. Haddad&rsquo;s definition of refugee distinguishes itself from the UN definition by including what the UN calls internally displaced persons, which are a category distinct from refugees for the UN. Because of this, I will use Haddad&rsquo;s definition of a refugee to also speak about IDPs.
The term &ldquo;economic migrant&rdquo; will be defined as the opposite of a refugee, describing someone that has not been forced, but still outside their domestic political community. Notably, these two definitions leave out the aspect of influence. It is commonly assumed that refugees, cut off from their homeland, have lower levels of agency and cannot influence history or their surroundings. Economic migrants are assumed to have &ldquo;given up&rdquo; the same agency when making the choice, as the freely chose to leave their domestic political community. However, migrants leave a profound impact on the countries they arrive in and contribute to history as a &ldquo;contribute to History to such an extent that they may be at crucial moments considered a generative force behind&rdquo; footcite:blumi_ottoman_2013.
If the migrant is taken to have agency and not remain as a mere object of pity, as Blumi describes, then the actor left with the most responsibility for violence incurred is simply the one that prevents the migrant from exercising their agency, namely states and organizations that engage in segregative biopolitics. Migrants who are denied their agency are seen as objects of pity, and the reproduction of this stereotype requires refugees to be passive victims. In order to understand what this looks like in Lebanon, we first turn to the status of the Palestinians.
Section I of the 1990 Lebanese constitution describes the territory of Lebanon, specifically stating &ldquo;There shall be no segregation of the people on the basis of any type of belonging, and no fragmentation, partition, or settlement of non-Lebanese in Lebanon&rdquo; footcite:noauthor_constitution_1996. The &ldquo;settlement of non-Lebanese in Lebanon&rdquo; is widely understood to be in reference to the 170,000 Palestinians currently living within Lebanon . In addition to this reference, Lebanon is not party to the 1951 UN Refugee Convention, nor is there any codified national legislation with reference to refugees. As a result, the only formal rules governing refugees are enumerated with the 2003 Memorandum of Understanding, signed between Lebanon and UNHCR.
The delicate sectarian balance in Lebanon results in a highly politicized environment for refugees. The Palestinian presence is politically charged owning to the status of Palestinian Liberation Organization in the 1970&rsquo;s, when Beirut served as the headquarters for the PLO . The Cairo Agreement, signed in 1969, provides for the right of Palestinians to both work and &lsquo;participate in the Palestinian revolution through the Armed Struggle&rsquo; . However, actions of the PLO, followed then by the Israeli occupation have eroded the working understanding of the Cairo Agreement, leaving Palestinians in a delicate position. Hezbollah&rsquo;s presence, even as Hezbollah becomes more entrenched within Lebanese domestic politics, has also not subsumed the Palestians&rsquo; struggle, having linked itself in various ways during the second Intifada . All throughout, the presence of UNRWA has provided for the bulk of services, even though UNRWA exercises no physical territorial authority .
The relatively long stay of Palestinians has made them difficult to neatly classify within the poles of &ldquo;refugee&rdquo; or &ldquo;economic migrant&rdquo;. As a result, the Palestinian presence consistently must renegotiate with at least three different actors at any time: the Lebanese state, the Lebanese public, and UNRWA. The failure of the Lebanese state to ratify legislation regarding refugees leads to violence in the form of neglect: the Lebanese state does not adequately provide or even enumerate what its responsibilities are. The Lebanese public exerts a more mental form of violence, sectarian balance and Lebanese domestic politics means the Palestinians are forever thought of as a political football. UNRWA acts as a &ldquo;phantom authority&rdquo; , an actor that prolongs the current Palestinian state by providing them with a fraction of the services that a state should provide. This too is a form of violence, prolonging the quasi-refugee state of Palestinans with no hope of assimilation into Lebanon, like a doctor who prolongs the suffering of a patient.
The Syrian condition in Lebanon is equally dire as the Palestinians, even though they might more easily slot into the widly accepted concept of &ldquo;refugee&rdquo;. The sectarian problem again looms overhead, large influxes of Syrians risk upsetting the demographic balance. Initially un-encamped, various forms of movement restrictions have arisen, both on the state level and municipal levels . Since 2013, the status of Syrians in Lebanon without entry permits is that they are &ldquo;illegal&rdquo;, which then deprives them of certain rights. The most important barrier to legal status is the renewal cost of the residency visa, which costs 200 USD annually. Without such payments, refugees are subject to deportation action, including back to Syria. This has forced Syrian refugees to enter through unofficial checkpoints, or to return to Syria and re-enter Lebanon in order to receive a new residency visa without requiring to pay the renewal costs . This follows the historical fact that making immigration illegal does not necessarily act as a deterrence, but rather forces migrants into extra-legal territory. The violence these Syrians face, either on their temporary return to Syria or at the hands of black market smugglers, are caused by the Lebanese state.
Syrians also face racially charged language during their stay in Lebanon. Only allowed to work in the sectors of agriculture, construction, and environment/cleaning, these sectors were chosen because government officials have reportedly believed Syrians are &ldquo;experts&rdquo; in these fields footcite:janmyr_precarity_2016. This racialized taxonomy of who a Syrian is aligns with the sponsorship system required for Syrians; Syrians are required to find a Lebanese sponsor who is liable for them footcite:janmyr_precarity_2016. These notions all constitute a form of mental violence against Syrians, subjecting Syrians to a racialized taxonomy of workers.
Foreign workers make up the last block of migrants in Lebanon. Under the same sponsorship system that exists in other places within the Middle East, Filopino and Sri Lankan domestic workers were first brought in, with workers from Nepal, Bangladesh, and Ethiopia following. Over 209,000 work permits are now active in Lebanon for foreign workers . Their choice to come to Lebanon initially makes them appear to be easily classified as &ldquo;economic migrants&rdquo;, but they ecounter the same segregative biopolitics as Palestinians or Syrians. Without organizations like UNRWA and UNHCR to manage them, foreign workers face violence in the forms of prolonged family separation and risk of physical violence from the Lebanese public.
In 2006, Sri Lankan workers were locked up and left behind by their employers. Kundbsejen Rujani and Raniya Yoself were locked and left behind by their employers to die beneath the bombs . Their employers, who charged them with &ldquo;taking care of the house&rdquo; are responsible for physical violence against foreign workers, denial of movement during wartime scenarios poses extremely physical risk.
Beyond restrictions of movement placed on foreign workers by their employers, an effective segregation system is in place for foreign workers in their day to day lives. In places where foreign workers are rarely seen, such as beach resorts, foreign workers are often denied entry, under the assumption that they are &ldquo;inherently uncleany&rdquo; . In addition, restrictions on movement on foreign workers extends beyond the physical places they can and cannot go to within Lebanon, but outside it as well. Many foreign workers, after working several years are asked by their employers to extend their time in Lebanon, or are frequently contacted after they have left Lebanon in order to get them to come back . Physical abuse and mental abuse of workers interlock within Lebanon, with the source being the Lebanese public that thrives off of low wage workers.
The status of al-akharin, whether it is within the status of Palestinians, Syrians, or forieng workers, is one of ambiguity. Each group must navigate Lebanon&rsquo;s various authorities, from the Palestinians under the shadow of UNRWA, to Syrians under the Lebanese state, to forieng workers under the Lebanese public. Yet the single thread among all of these is that each authority practices the politics of the other, UNRWA assumes responsibilities taken on by the state, inadvertently preventing greater integration of Palestinians into Lebanon, Syrians are actively discriminated against through legal mechanisms, and forieng workers face a social form of segregation by the public. Despite all the abuses, migrants in Lebanon have continued to exercise their agency wherever possible. Recent rounds of Palestinian protests on new restrictions against their working rights , along with domestic worker unions such as the Migrant Domestic Workers Union both show that migrants in Lebanon are continually renegotiating their position. They are not passive observers, but rather they seek to exercise their rights through action. In essence, the responsibility for violence against these groups arises from those that participate in the segregative biopolitical systems within Lebanon today.

https://alpinefellowship.com/welcome __Question__: Does the wild stand in opposition to civilisation, or are they both manifestations of the natural? Is our conception of the wild anthropic, indeed is it sentimental? When is it right to ‘live according to nature’, and when should we turn to science to rewire nature or ourselves? Indeed, what is our ‘natural’ state? And following a year in which so much interaction has been online, we ask how it affects this theme?
Draft The development of French archival science, born in the wake of the French Revolution, was the first conceptualization on the public status of documents cite:di-capua_gatekeepers_2009. This new line of thought, that documents contribute to a nation&rsquo;s heritage, and that access to that heritage should be publicly aligned with the Revolution&rsquo;s rebuttal of the ruling class. The &lsquo;holy&rsquo; King and divine rule were no longer sufficient, and the French Revolution began a process that &ldquo;brought Christianity down from Heaven to Earth&rdquo; cite:requejo_coll_1_2015, from the King to the people.
Notions of divinity, and associated priesthood of elites have always played into our conceptions of wilderness. Either as self-declared guardians against barbarians at the gate, or as fonts of reason and order, civilization has always been associated with divinity, and the wilderness with the inverse. Heaven and Hell, order and chaos, civilization and wilderness, all these conceptions stem from one core issue: a lack of understanding of the world&rsquo;s processes.
The earliest notions of the priesthood class interpreted the chaos of the world, divining truth from random actions. This class performed rituals that attempted to control or influence the chaos around them, beseeching rain for crops and recovery from illness. Divining intentions from perceived omens in nature or in dreams, this early class acted as the interpreters of divine will.
In other words, priesthood is an act of information transformation. Mathematicians have a word for actions that change information without losing any details, this is a property called isomorphism. For example, a mirror is isomorphic, it preserves all the aspects of light, except it flips them. To be more precise: isomorphism is when two complex structures each have corresponding parts in the other structure, the mirror version of yourself has all your body parts, just like the real you. But mathematicians care about isomorphism not because of their simple physical properties, isomorphisms is imply meaning. The isomorphism of the real you and the mirror you shows that you exist, that your existence in the physical world is real. Is it any wonder that the fantasies of walking through a mirror to another world abound in our cultures?
Back to the priesthood class. The priesthood class acted as human isomorphisms, attempting to take all the information available and translate them into insights. Their isomorphism was not a mirror, but rather a translation, they heard the language of the divine and spoke in the language of humans.
Despite the fall of religion from its apogee from the French Revolution, it did not change the need for people to interpret the world. Instead, as identified by scholars such as Bernard Anderson, the nascent forms of nationalism developed via French archival science grew due to the burgeoning press. The printing press revolutionized how people saw each other and how they saw their communities, entire nations made legible to its citizens through the newspaper.
The awesome power of this has led the field of journalism to great heights, and with it came ideas that the press had the capability to inform and control public opinion, leading to the term of the &ldquo;fourth estate&rdquo;. Journalism provided an uniform truth, a single way to understand the world, becoming a new papacy in its zenith. Journalists could dictate truth from far away places like Baghdad to people in their homes.
The ability of journalism to provide consensus has been its contemporary downfall. Platform companies and social media such as Twitter and Facebook shatter the conceptions of a consensus, rather they all put forth their own truth. Yet we must also shy away from the tired criticisms of social media and look deeper. Social media, when viewed from the perspective of the user and participant, is an isomorphism in disguise, and with it comes meaning. Instagram and Twitter are mirrors, albeit distorted ones, but mirrors nevertheless. They are the evil versions of ourselves standing on the other side of the mirror.
We must also not lose sight that the platform companies who build social media are not passive actors. They are systems, built and maintained by real people, who consciously and unconsciously impart their biases onto their creations. All technology is a lever, meant to amplify effort and labor cite:alice_maz_priesthood_2017, and these companies are no different. They amplify our voices, our small efforts into massive ones, allowing us unprecedented reach, all the while chipping away at the consensus we have built, bringing more and more chaos into our conversations. In many ways, programmers have replaced the journalists as the papacy at the altar of interpretation, with one key difference: early priests and journalists made the world legible, they were isomorphisms that made things smaller, whereas programmers are the opposite, programmers provide tools to make the world illegible. Priests and journalists reduced the chaos to the average person, programmers cram all the chaos of the world into a six inch screen. If the French revolution brought Christanity to Earth, the social media revolution raises our voices to the Heavens.
Chaos takes the front stage here, because civilization has always been defined its opposition to chaos. Chaos is associated with the concept of the wilderness. Edward Said defined orientalism as a stage, a theatrical stage for which the European West could impart its biases, but a stage that defines the West. The backdrop of the savage Orientals allowed Europeans to feel superior in civilization. This theatre allowed the West to pose itself as a bastion of civilization against the wilderness of the Orient, a repulsive line of thought still seen today. Said also stated that the West could not exist without the Orient, for without a caricature to mock, the West would be forced to reflect inwardly.
Social media now takes the stage formerly occupied by the Orient. All of us are encouraged, through the tools created by the priests of the machine, to act as caricatures of ourselves, becoming the most debased form of ourselves. In a year largely spent on the computer, dreaming of escaping to the physical wilderness of the mountains, I have realized my understanding of &ldquo;wilderness&rdquo; only overlaps with &ldquo;the outdoors&rsquo;&rsquo; by happenstance. I now realize wilderness is wherever chaos resides, for wilderness is defined as the inverse of civilization, and chaos is the lead actor. Our wilderness is no longer the outdoors, nearly every inch of this Earth has been explored. Our new wilderness is one of ourselves, and of other people. If divinity and Heaven are ruled by decree, then what does the chaos of humans make?
I am an astrophysicist by undergraduate training, an artificial intelligence programmer by trade, and a Near Eastern studies graduate student. I believe the Alpine Fellowship would provide an excellent opportunity for me synthesize all of my training and education through supporting my research and studies. My current work focuses on the properties of Mandarin and English, and finding the isomorphisms that exist in between. I hope to add Arabic onto that work, as Arabic proficiency is a requirement for graduate degree. I hope that the combination of Arabic, English, and Mandarin yields more insight into languages, for systems of threes are very peculiar in nature. Graph theory teaches us that a triad reveals previously hidden information about the dyadic structures, history teaches us that triumvirates are unstable political systems, and astrophysics is still plagued by the three-body problem. In other words, systems of threes seem to be naturally unstable, and therefore naturally chaotic and wild.
I believe mathematics offers the key to building sustainable policies of statebuilding, not so much the results, but the process for which mathematics is done. I hope to contribute much to the fields of linguistics and reintegration policy, guided in part by the thinkers at the Alpine Consortium.
My research focuses on best practices to reintegrate ex-combatants of militias back into the Iraqi state. While this may seem to be an offshoot, I believe there are significant opportunities to bridge my research and my work. Reintegration and disarmament programs often fail because they are imposed top down, from organizations such as the state or the UN. Critically, these programs fail because these programs do not appreciate the local level politics, often due to issues with communication. My focus on the Iraqi dialect of Arabic aims to help bridge this local-state gap, and my studies on history, sociology, and political science at NYU will help to flesh out these policies. Funding from the Alpine Fellowship would allow me to engage in further research, such as conducting interviews and traveling to volunteer with NGOs.

Split occured in late 2016
The rebels were not happy with the new notes. It&rsquo;s easy to guess why. Fresh money could be used to pay government fighters, not rebel fighters. This &ldquo;blood money&rdquo; would then cheekily flow north via trade. Since anyone who holds a banknote is by definition funding the government that issues it with a no-interest loan, the rebel north was financing its own enemies. (The technical term for this sort of financing is seigniorage).

Despite this, the CBY’s financial coordination with local governing entities persisted. Prior to the outbreak of war, local councils in the country’s various governorates would regularly collect taxes and revenues on behalf of the central government and submit these to their local CBY branch. In return, the CBY would disperse operating funds to the local councils for public sector salaries and the provision of local services, as proportioned in the national budget.

Talks about the &ldquo;Memory House of Ataturk&rdquo; (mustafa kemal) as a focal point for macedonian ethnic identities, utilization of Ataturk as a symbol and claiming him (either through his lineage or pan-Turkishness) to be a rallying point.
historical consciousness is not a homogenous but rather a multilayered and complex process which can encompass apparently contradicting narratives of the past, not only within one nation-state - pg 12
3 types of self identification:
Macedonian &ldquo;Turk&rdquo; &lt;- isolated to the Lower Zupa region Torbesi Identities revolve around primordialist arguments but are linked to political ones:
&ldquo;Macedonians&rdquo; support Macedonian political parties, the majority of the &ldquo;Turks&rdquo; vote for the Democratic Party of the Turks, and the Torbesi support the Part for European Future - PEI, which have actively worked for the legal recongition of the Torbesi as a separate ethnic group - pg 4
Who own Ataturk? Based on ideals that Ataturk&rsquo;s father was born in Kocacik, some groups claim ethic Turkishness Application of a constructed identity in modern times flowing backwards in time possibly helped by the Turkish nation&rsquo;s embracing of Ottoman identities - Danforth: The Ottoman Empire from 1923 to Today `}),e.add({id:1772,href:"/posts/zaidi/",title:"zaidi",content:`Tags: islam

Summary Set up a set of classification tasks for offensive language across multiple languages
Identification of offensive languages (y/n on whether something is offensive) Automatic categorization of offensive types (targeted or not targeted?) targeted - insults towards a group or individual not targeted - profanity or swearing Target identification (invidual, group, other) other category includes organizations, events, issues Used the Offensive Language Identification Dataset (OLID), a 14k+ english tweets with the three types of identification labeled\\
Teams were provided OLID and SOLID (Semi-supervised offensive language identification dataset)
Language breakdown
Arabic dataset had 10k tweets (twitter langauge filter on lang:ar) Danish had 3.6k comments from FB, Reddit, and local newspaper Greek used the Offensive Greek Twitter Dataset, 10k+ tweets Turkish used 35k+ tweets Models
Most teams used contextualized transformers (Bert/Roberta/mBert) Wordembeddings also showed up, some sentiment analysis as well Results

Zwet, Erik van, and Eric Cator. “The Significance Filter, the Winner’s Curse and the Need to Shrink.” ArXiv:2009.09440 [Stat], September 20, 2020. http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.09440. &ldquo;Signficance filter&rdquo; means only focusing on statistically significant results, which means that it can lead to an overestimation of the magnitude of the parameter.
Attempts to study this from a bayesian perspective, shows that the
the relativebias of the magnitude is a decreasing function of the power and thatthe usual confidence interval undercovers when the power is less than50%. We conclude that failure to apply the appropriate amount ofshrinkage can lead to misleading inferences.
Basically only focusing on statistically significant data means that the intervals are poorly estimated, since the significance filter is a step function
